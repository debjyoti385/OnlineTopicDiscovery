( Read More in Cricket ) McGrath Foundation co-founder and president Glenn McGrath presented the Australian team with their baggy pink caps for the traditional pre-Test team photo and announced the need for increased funding to address the national shortfall in breast care nurses, according to a Cricket Australia (CA) release. \"With 43 Australians diagnosed with breast cancer every day there is critical and continuing need for more McGrath Breast Care Nurses to support families through breast cancer,\" McGrath said. \"This year we've set our Pink Test fundraising goal at $380,000, which will fund one new McGrath Breast Care Nurse for three years.\" Beginning January 3, the Pink Test has become an iconic event, in particular Day 3 of the Test that has come to be known as Jane McGrath Day. On that day the entire crowd turns pink to support the McGrath Foundation and raise funds to place McGrath Breast Care Nurses in communities all over Australia. Cricket Australia chief executive officer James Sutherland said: \"We're incredibly proud to be supporting the McGrath Foundation, with the Pink Test in Sydney now truly one of the great occasions on the Australian sporting calendar.\" \"Every year we're amazed by the overwhelming support the Pink Test generates for the Foundation and its important work. From the two competing teams to the thousands of fans who bathe the SCG in pink, it demonstrates the positive difference sport can make to society,\" he said. \"Thanks to the cricket community, the Test has raised more than $5 million, helping the McGrath Foundation place 110 breast care nurses across Australia and demonstrating cricket's ability to galvanise public support behind an important cause,\" Sutherland added. Research from the McGrath Foundation shows that in 2016 there will be a shortfall of 85 breast care nurses across the country and this figure will grow by 28 percent by 2020.

New Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had initially promised to resettle 25,000 Syrian refugees by December 31. But his Liberal government then pushed the target date to end-February, following criticism it was moving too fast amid security concerns in the aftermath of deadly attacks in Paris as well as logistical issues. The interim target of taking in 10,000 Syrian refugees by year's end was set in late November. But as of Thursday, with the arrival of three charter planes carrying about 800 refugees, the total stood at slightly more than 6,000. \"I am confident that a full 10,000 refugees would have landed in two weeks by mid-January and also that 25,000 would have arrived in Canada by the end of February,\" Immigration Minister John McCallum told reporters. Beyond the 6,000 Syrians already on Canadian soil, another 4,700 are already cleared for arrival, McCallum said. Health Minister Jane Philpott noted: \"Had we not set such incredibly audacious goals, I know, I can tell you, we would not be where we are today.\" Earlier in December, Trudeau personally welcomed the first group to arrive at Toronto airport aboard a military transport plane. But the leftist opposition New Democratic Party on Thursday lamented that the government had failed to reach its initial goal of resettling 25,000 refugees by year's end. The migrant crisis in Europe emerged on Canada's campaign trail in 2015 following intense media coverage of the death of Syrian toddler Aylan Kurdi, whose lifeless body on a beach in Turkey became a symbol of the crisis. Relatives of Kurdi arrived this week in Canada, where they hope to rebuild their lives. Canada takes in an average of 250,000 refugees from around the world each year. The UN refugee agency estimates that more than four million Syrians have fled the civil war ravaging their country. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights puts the total number of dead at more than 260,000 people.

However, Ahmed lost his fight with cancer and died at Mumbais Lilavati Hospital on September 27. Present Governor V Shanmuganathan was then sworn in on September 30.  During his tenure, Ahmed had declined to give assent to the Manipur Tenants, Visitors and Migrant Workers Bill, 2015 which was passed by the assembly on March 15. It was withdrawn on August 16 during a special session.

The first truck carrying about 6 soldiers also had barrels of fuel which exploded. The second truck was carrying about 18-19 soldiers while the rest of about 46 member-strong convoy were in other trucks. The bodies of majority of the soldiers were charred completely.  Army also killed an NSCN-K and a KYKL militant in the ambush.  Nearly 40 militant groups have been operating in trouble-torn Manipur for about four decades now. The rebel groups have been boycotting and calling general strikes in Manipur on Republic Day and Independence Day every year during the last decade and same was the case in 2015.  Bandhs, general strikes and economic blockades took a heavy toll on the states economy. A survey claimed that Manipur lost Rs 36 crore daily every time when there was a bandh or general strike and Rs 3.09 crore per day when there was an economic blockade. PTI COR ZMN DIP", "day": 1}

I would pick him in both formats since he is a match winner,\" he added.

Steindorff had also sought compensation for hospital and other medical expenses.  Jenners insurance company will be making the settlement payment to Steindorff.

Howe hit her brakes after Steindorffs car stopped in front of her, but was then rear-ended by Jenners car, which caused Howes vehicle to collide with a Hummer H2 in oncoming traffic.  The family driving the Hummer filed a lawsuit against Jenner this month, while Howes adult stepchildren also have a civil action lawsuit against Jenner. These two claims are still ongoing.  In September, Jenner was not criminally charged for the incident.

Another win to Sri Lanka would level the series at two wins apiece and turn the fifth and final game into the decider. A key piece of intelligence New Zealand took from the third match at Nelson's Saxton Oval on Thursday was a sign the pitch is starting to take turn. They were thoroughly outplayed in that match with Sri Lanka bettering their 276-run total for the loss of only two wickets against New Zealand's predominantly pace attack. The New Zealand bowling line-up is already destined for a shake-up with Tim Southee ruled out with an injured left foot, earning a recall for Matt Henry who took four wickets in each of the first two matches. But consideration is also being given to dropping one of the quick bowlers in favour of pairing the leg-break option of Ish Sodhi with the left-arm spin of Mitchell Santner. Santner, who went for a wicketless 59 off his 10 overs in Nelson, said the pitch flattened out during the day with a suggestion of spin. \"It's starting to turn a little bit so the spinners might get more of a crack,\" he said, but added: \"It's still going to be a good batting surface so pushing that 300 mark could be a competitive score.\" Kane Williamson, standing in as captain while Brendon McCullum recovers from a sore back, confirmed the two-spinner option was under discussion. \"You assess the wicket and you look at the squad and pick the team that best suits the conditions. Naturally they (spinners) will come into a chance to play in the next one.\" Williamson was not impressed with the way Southee, Adam Milne and Doug Bracewell set about defending New Zealand's 276 total. \"We didn't bowl particularly well in that first 10 which didn't help our cause.

Indicating the failures of the Left government in the state, Amartya Sen said that after destroying the economy, the party was now trying to regain its foothold in the state ahead of the 2016 Assembly elections. While delivering a lecture on 'Shishu Swasthya: Nana dik, nana mot, nana kaaj (Child Health: Various paths, various views, various acts) at a college in Santiniketan in Bolpur in Birbhum district, the economist tore into the Left wing for its poor performance in the economic sector during its 34-years of regime. Sen questioned the party's thinking in vital issues by saying that the party failed to apply basic reasoning in its decisions during policy formulation.

Only when they decided that policies must be changed, the people decided to change the government instead. I think there is some problem in the way with which the Left party thinks over an issue,\" Sen said. Sen also said that it was during the Left regime that investments abandoned the state, agricultural development declined and Bengal got ruined.  Citing an example, Sen said that earlier, there would be 18 flights from Kolkata to London in a week. \"Bengal once had a lot of businesses at one point of time. For instance, there used to be 18 flights a week to London. Perhaps, why we used to have so many visitors coming down on a regular basis,\" Amartya Sen said. On the Left's criticism of the state government, Amartya Sen said that it was important to discuss solutions to problems and issues rather than indulging in a blame game.  \"They are now criticising. It is okay to criticise but before above that, it is more important to figure out what we must do. It is necessary to understand what is lacking in the government and what the people are demanding,\" Sen said.

Superintendent of Police, Gurdaspur Salwinder Singh told the police that he alongwith his friend and a junior colleague were returning to Gurdaspur after paying obiesence at a local shrine Narot Jaimal Singh when they were signalled to stop by five men in army fatigue . Salwinder Sing told the police that the armed men barged into their MU vehicle and started beating them. One of them took the driver's seat and drove the vehicle towards Pathankot.Singh was pushed off the vehicle and his colleague and friend were driven to some distance.One of the  companions was pushed out of the vehicle near Pathankot and another near Damtal area after he pretended to be dead. The abductors also slit his throat.One of the seriously injured companion identified as Rajesh Kumamr has been admitted to a Pathankot hospital. The incident according to the police took place around 4 AM when Salwinder Singh and his companions were on their back to Gurdaspur after paying obeisance at the shrine.Five armed men in army fatigue attacked them,\" SP Pathankot R K Bakshi said. The police has refused to disclose the exact location where the cop and his companions were abducted and thrown. Sources said they were abducted from a point on Pathankot-Bamial link road which connects Dinanagar- where three heavily armed militants dressed in army uniform on 27 July 2015 had opened fire on a bus and then attacked the Dina Nagar police station in Gurdaspur district,Punjab  While the seriously injured Rajkumar who was in the MU vehicle is not in a position to record a statement, Salwinder Singh and his colleague are being questioned by the security agencies.The police has not disclosed much information about the incident which may be vital from security point of view. The agencies are also struggling to find out the motive of the abduction.The kidnappers neither killed the abducted cop and his companions nor took them hostages so chances of them being militants are also appear to be thin. However, the security agencies are primarily considering this as a militant attack as both Gurdaspur and Pathankot districts are located on Indo-Pak border.However, none of the militant groups have so far taken the responsibility of the attack. Meanwhile,the Punjab police called an emergent meeting and later beefed up security in two districts.The agencies are verifying the abduction case as claimed by the senior cop. The police has registered a case against unidentified persons and have launched a search operation to trace the abductors. The police is also investigating the murder of Ekagar Singh of Phulpur village whose body was also recovered from the area.The bridge from where the body was recovered is located at a distance of 15 kms from Indo-Pak border.Dinalagar is also located at a same distance from the place from where the cop ,his colleague and friend were abducted.", "section": "Crime, Law and Order", "topics": {"PUBLIC FIGURES, LEADERS": 0.32, "POLICE": 0.24, "NATIONAL SECURITY, TERRORISM, SECURITY AGENCY": 0.12}, "day": 1}

The nations largest lender also ruled out going ahead with its share sale plan this fiscal.  Last October, SBI had reduced its base rate by 40 basis points, from 9.70 per cent per to 9.30 per cent.  \"I dont really think (base rate will be cut) so, but maybe once we cross the year end then we will see,\" SBI Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya told reporters after opening the second InTouch branch at Colaba in South Mumbai.  The rate reduction by SBI was following a 50 bps repo rate cut by the RBI on September 29.  Earlier this week, private sector HDFC Bank reduced its base rate by 0.05 per cent to 9.30 per cent, matching with that of SBI, 5 bps lower than its private sector rival ICICI Bank, which is maintaining its minimum lending rate at 9.35 per cent.  Talking about the new base rate calculation based on the marginal cost of funds, Bhattacharya said the formula will not make a huge amount of difference on base rate but will help in transmission. \"Some more amount of transmission will definitely happen but I dont think it is going to be humongous.\"  However, many analysts have pegged an 80-160 bps reduction in base rate by banks from April when the new method will be in force.  On the Rs 12,000-crore follow-on public offer that the bank is planning to raise, she said SBI is unlikely to raise the money in this fiscal. The bank had been planning this OFS sale even in last fiscal as market was not conducive.  \"I dont think we have any clear plans now. I dont think it will happen this fiscal year but then lets see.\"  After a meeting of its Committee of Directors on December 21, 2015, the bank had said in a regulatory filing that it had got permission to raise up to Rs 12,000 crore by selling Basel-III compliant tier-II bonds on a private placement basis.  Following this, SBI had on December 24 raised Rs 4,000 crore through tier-II bonds on private placement basis under the Basel-III norms.  On the RBI deadline of March 2017 to clean up the balancesheets, Bhattacharya said the banks are in dialogue with the RBI.

While complimenting the people of Delhi for \"success\" of odd-even formula, the ministers also said that future implementation of the scheme will depend on the people and how they respond to it.

Given the sluggish trends in the real estate market and continued fall in gold prices, the mutual fund industry also expect to begin attracting a larger share of the Indian households savings from this year. Mutual funds invested almost USD 11 billion (Rs 70,716 crore) in domestic equities in 2015, more than 2.5-times of about USD 4 billion infused last year, as per the latest data. Retail money flew into equities through mutual funds route supported the benchmark indices at a time when the foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) went on a selling spree. FPIs were net buyers of equities to the tune of just USD 3.2 billion in 2015. Before that, they had invested USD 20 billion each in stock markets in the preceding three years. \"We look forward to a similar scenario like this years where FPIs invested USD 3 billion in 2015, whereas domestic mutual funds have seen strong inflows. This means that while FPIs are considerably important, it is the domestic inflows that are here to stay for the long term that will fuel growth,\" Quantum AMC CEO Jimmy Patel said. The industry players feel that the outlook remains bullish for the New Year in terms of equity markets. \"Considering softer commodity prices, muted real estate market and flattish debt market scenario in 2016, the outlook for equity in 2016 continues to remain encouraging. While the current years inflow number may not be matched, the inflows nevertheless are likely to remain positive,\" Jayesh Shroff, Fund Manager (Equities) at SBI Mutual Fund said. However, LIC Nomura Mutual Fund Chief Investment Officer (Equity and Debt) Saravana Kumar said: \"Maintaining the same momentum (in terms of inflows) may be a challenge if 2016 turns out to be as volatile as the past year.\" The fund houses also saw a growing interest from retail investors, indicating an emerging shift in their investment preferences from physical assets to financial assets. The inflows from retail category were close to Rs 1.7 lakh crore in 2015, a major upswing compared to Rs 1.3 lakh crore seen in the entire 2014. \"Retail participation has shown remarkable resilience to market volatility and we are confident that it will continue in 2016,\" Reliance Mutual Fund CEO Sundeep Sikka said. Patel said that retail participation could provide the much needed liquidity to the stock markets that have been largely driven by FPIs for the past few years. Just 10 million people of the 1.2 billion plus population of India are estimated to be mutual fund investors. \"Equities are likely to emerge as one of the best performing asset classes over the long run and investor are expected to prefer the asset class on higher growth potential coupled with relatively lower attractiveness of alternative investment options,\" he said. Besides, equity-oriented mutual funds would remain preferred vehicle for equity market exposure. Equity assets crossed Rs 4 lakh crore mark for the first time in the history of Indian mutual fund industry, signaling the return of domestic investors taking the mutual fund route. Overall net investment in MF in 2015-16 is more than the cumulative investment during the entire previous bull-run, which took place between 2003-04 and 2007-08. \"While we could continue to see a soaring retail participation in MFs, power reforms package announced already several times could be finally undertaken, the expectation of 2016 could be a LaNina year is favouring the Indian monsoon, inflation, Oil and Rupee balancing out and last but not the least the Fed rate hike are some factors that could influence the next year for the MF industry,\" Patel said.

Gigato, which is owned by tech startup Mavin, was launched in India in 2015. It credits back Internet data to consumers for accessing websites or content on its platform irrespective of the network they use.  \"We as a company are firm believers in creating a net neutral product. We have ensured the principles of net neutrality are held up on both the consumer and the app publisher or developer front,\" Co-founder and CMO Strategy of Mavin, Raina Kumra told PTI.  While, supporting its own platform, Free Basics, social media giant Facebook recently in a post had questioned host of services including Aircels free internet service, Mozillas idea of equal rating system as well as Gigatos toll free Internet.  \"Gigato requires applications to pay to be featured, which is potentially damaging to startups who cant afford to be part of the program,\" Facebook had said.

They are free to use it how they please, without restrictions. On the developer front, every app publisher on the platform pays the same flat rate data cost without any difference in pricing.\"  Mavin cited quote of Advocacy Director at net freedom advocacy group Access Josh Levy who said \"The Mavin model is a non-discriminatory approach to helping people use data-hungry apps,\" to uphold its claim.  Facebooks Free Basics is also a free Internet platform where user is not required to pay data charges for accessing websites or application present on it.

Neither Facebook nor its content partners pay the operators for the data people consume through Free Basics. Finally, Free Basics is not exclusive to any operator, and Facebook is willing to work with any operator that wants to provide free basic services,\" the social media giant said.  Kumra said Gigato does not has any exclusive deals and no way to pay for placements.  \"To counter sort order bias we also shift the order of appearance of our offers at random.

The move by hacking community is to ensure that no information is being leaked via social networking websites, which can be used against the nation. The step was taken after reports of defence personnel's involvement in the ISI spy racket surfaced. The Crime Branch of Delhi Police on Monday arrested IAF airman Ranjith KK, who was honey trapped by ISI agency by creating a fake profile on Facebook. He had been talking to \"pretty woman\" Damini McNaught for the last several months on Facebook and was passing sensitive details related to the Air Force. Recently, security agencies arrested serving and retired defence personnel from various locations who were leaking information to Pakistani security agency ISI. \"We will follow the modus operandi used by international agents. We will track Indian officers and will try to get information from them. The moment they pass any information, we will alert the security agency giving proof against them,\" said a hacker who claims to be a part of ethical hacking community Anonymous-India. There are close to 2,000 retired and serving officers who are under the scanner of security agencies for suspectedly passing information for money or through honey trap. Admitting the process of tracking is illegal, hackers said the move is in national interest. \"It is an illegal and a time taking process but the underground community is ready for surveillance to shield the country from outsiders,\" said a hacker on the condition of anonymity. Cyber experts claim that international spies from countries like Pakistan, US and China have maximum interest in gathering information from India. The international spying agencies, in order to make their spying activities seamless, untraceable and invisible, also carry out high-tech attacks which compromise the computer and network, but they carry out targeted attack on social media so that they get insider classified information. \"Spies have created many fake profiles on social media. These profiles are of different nature which includes different sex, age, cast and nationality with distinct interests. They use it according to their targets. A dedicate team of spies is working to track vulnerable people on social media,\" said cyber crime expert Kislay Choudhary, who works closely with Delhi and Noida police. \"As a person discloses that he works for Army, Navy or the Air Force, he/she comes on the radar of international spies who start following them on the virtual world. By some means, which includes honey trap, they start interacting with the user. Spies also keep a track of their interest or hobbies to make a conversation and get friendly,\" Choudhary explained.

He appeared on \"M*A*S*H\" for only the first three of 11 seasons, but the army surgeon was one of the most popular characters on the show.   He turned down the Trapper John role in the series because he did not want to be typecast as a physician.  Rogers was born in Alabama and while serving in the Navy, he started acting and worked in the theatre in the 1950s before getting small film roles in movies such as \"The Glory Guys\" and \"Cool Hand Luke.\"  For Broadway, he co-produced Neil Simons \"Brighton Beach Memoirs,\" \"Biloxi Blues,\" \"Broadway Bound\" and a revival of \"The Odd Couple\".

He called on army soldiers to embrace honourable traditions, adapt to changing situations in the digital age and explore new patterns in land battles.  The army needs to optimise its structure and composition, expedite its transformation from regional defence to universal fighting and build itself into a powerful modern land force.  A new force in safeguarding national security, the SSF represents \"an important growth point\" of the Chinese military in modern war, Xi said.  Xi called on the soldiers of the force to achieve leapfrogging development in key fields, set a high bar and strive to build a strong modern strategic support force.  Under the new structure of the military command system all wings of PLA will operate under a joint operational command.  China has seven military area commands - Beijing, Nanjing, Chengdu, Jinan, Shenyang, Lanzhou and Guangzhou.

The Modi government had adopted two-pronged approach to generate jobs and its Make in India initiative has resulted in the improvement of manufacture sector, Sharma said.  Over 80 lakh people were given loans without any collateral under the MUDRA scheme to push self-employment, he claimed.  Taking Congress on after it blamed the government for the stalemate over the GST bill, he alleged the opposition was not \"serious\" about its passage and that Modi had reached out to its chief  Sonia Gandhi  and Singh but they did not respond positively.  \"Congress stalled Parliament over non-issues,\" Sharma said.  A number of international agencies had acknowledged the growing strength of India economy, he said and cited a report that ranked the country as the most attractive destination for investment out of 110. The ranking was based on an index for baseline profitability.  India jumped to nine from 15 in the ranking of countries based on their attractiveness for FDI, which was brought out by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad), he said.

Aamir, who served a five-year ban and jail time for indulging in spot-fixing during the 2010 tour of England, was expected to make the squad after being brought back into the national camp despite some resentment by fellow players. \"We have picked Aamir in the touring squads for the internationals in New Zealand because he has done lot of hard work and shown intent to do well for Pakistan since returning to domestic cricket last year,\" chief selector Haroon Rasheed told PTI. But Aamirs comeback to international cricket remains dependent on him getting a visa and clearance to tour New Zealand, Haroon said. \"If there are problems with travel documents and Aamir cant tour than Muhammad Irfan will replace him in the T20 squad. Irfan is not originally selected in the T20 squad because we want to give him a short break from the game,\" Haroon said. Aamir, 23, last appeared for the national team in a Test against England at Lords in August 2010 before the scandal came to the fore. Aamir and two other players -- captain Salman Butt and Muhammad Asif -- were suspended by the International Cricket Council after the Test for taking money to bowl predetermined no-balls in a spot fixing scam. The trio was than banned in February 2011 for five years for spot-fixing by the anti-corruption tribunal of the ICC and also served varying jail terms for corruption and cheating in the United Kingdom. Their bans expired in September last year and the ICC, under a special clause of its anti-corruption code, allowed relaxation to Aamir to resume playing domestic cricket in early 2015. The left-arm pacer was just 18 and had appeared in 14 Tests, 15 ODIs and 18 T20 internationals when he played in the Lords Test. It remains to be seen whether he would be able to reproduce the same form and talent he showcased five years back.

There are growing number of people who after several visits to the West and to places like Bangkok, Singapore and Dubai look for something different. The book describes trips the author has undertaken to South America that included Patagonia and the Antarctic.  Some of the trips are eminently doable, Ghate says, adding that the Gringo trail in Latin America and Silk Road are very popular.  Antarctica is like visiting another planet. Yet, both Patagonia and Antarctica are both reasonably accessible even to a budget traveller. He often tells his friends to put off upgrading their cars, Ghate says.  He explains how he flew to Buenos Aires, travelled down overland through Argentina to the end of the world in Ushuaia and from there used a cruise (which came cheap) to Antarctica.  The book says air travel allows a plethora of fascinating stopover opportunities for travellers taking flights to the West. Addis Ababa, the major hub of Ethiopian Airlines, sits in the middle of a rich and ancient civilisation and has amazing landscape, rock-cut churches, the author says.  What is important, the book says, is to have interest in other cultures, an empathy for people, some tolerance for uncertainty and a willingness to rough it out occasionally.  He was struck when he noticed how carriage attendants in China invariably locked the toilets as the train approaches a station helping to keep the stations much cleaner.  Many of the railway station toilets in China are connected to biogas plants killing two birds in one stone, he says.  The most important reason to travel South is to experience it before it changes for ever, sucked up by the process of development and homogenisation, the book says.  The Silk Road is now a four-lane highway as vast areas of old housing are being knocked down in Chinese cities. It is still possible to do multi-country trips in the South flexibly and spontaneously, picking up visas on the way if one doesnt want to tie oneself down to a rigid itinerary.  Ghate has visited over 100 countries. In the book, published by Bloomsbury, he has narrated his experiences during travel to South America, the Philippines, Africa, Patagonia and China.

Police produced Chintan in Borivali Metropolitan Court, where they moved an application seeking permission to subject him to narco-analysis test as part of their probe into the sensational double murder case that came to light on December 12 when their bodies were found in a drain in Kandivali.  The 44-year-old artist, arrested on December 22, was produced in the Court of Magistrate Prasad Kulkarni after the end of his police custody.  The Investigating Officer told the court that police have recovered a personal dairy, pen drive, hard drives, memory card, IPad and sketches from Chintans house in Delhi.  The materials will be examined to ascertain if they have any link with the murders, he said.  Maintaining that the investigation in the case was complicated, police sought further remand of Chintan.  The officer informed said they want to interrogate Chintan further to find clues about Vidyadhar Rajbhar, a key accused in the case who is still on run.  They need to determine whether matrimonial cases involving Chintan and his estranged wife Hema (43) and dispute over their flat in upscale Juhu area were the motives behind the murders.  They are also questioning Chintan about a Bengaluru- based person, who had supplied sedative that was used for knocking out the victims, the officer said.  After the end of arguments, the Magistrate extended Chintans remand till January 4.  Meanwhile, the Court rejected Chintans plea to undergo health re-examination given his back problem.  Claiming that the artist has severe back problem, his lawyer Nitin Pradhan sought re-examination of his health condition and proper medical assistance for him.  There should be some place for human dignity. Considering that he has severe back problem, Chintan should be provided medical aid, he argued.  However, citing a medical report submitted by JJ Hospital, which claims Chintans health condition is normal, the court rejected the plea.   Pradhan said the Crime Branch, which interrogated Chintan for 10 days, should submit a case diary in the court.  Chintan is accused of conspiring to kill his wife and her lawyer with the help of other accused. The other accused - Pradip Rajbhar, Vijay Rajbhar, Shivkumar Rajbhar and Azaad Rajbhar - are in judicial custody till January 11.

The dismissal is seen as retaliatory, as on last Monday the Panj Piaras had asked the SGPC to remove the Jathedars of the five Takhts by January 1.  On December 28, taking strong exception to the non-implementation of their earlier Gurmata (religious edict) issued on October 23, the Panj Piaras said they would announce the future course of action for the Sikh community on January 2 next unless SGPC removed the Jathedars by January 1.  In a written statement issued to the media today, SGPC President AvtarSingh Makkar described all the Panj Piaras as \"paid employees\"and said the four employees were dismissed for \"grossly violating\" the service rules as well as Sikh religiousnorms and tenets.  Bhai Satnam Singh, Bhai Satnam Singh, Bhai Tarlok Singh and Bhai MangalSingh were dismissed, Makkarsaid while the fifth employee Bhai Major Singh was retired yesterday.

He said that these Panj Piaras while \"misusing their religious authorities have thrown challenge before Highest Sikh Temporal Seat AkalTakhat as well as sitting Jathedar of Akal Takhat Gyani Gurbachan Singh.\"  Makkar said that they had hatched \"deep rooted conspiracy\" toextend damage to the Supreme Authority of the Akal Takht.  He said that if Panj Piaras were announcing religious decision as per theirown choice especially against the sitting Jathedar Akal Takht it wouldcreate mess and severe restlessness among the Sikh community, hence suchactivities would never be tolerated and to besnubbed forthwith.  Earlier on October 21, the Panj Piaras had in an unprecedented move challenged the working of the Sikh clergy and summoned the five Sikh high priests, including the Jathedar Akal Takht Gyani Gurbachan Singh, on October 23 to explain the pardon extended to the Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and later withdrawing the same.

While the goal of polio virus eradication is in sight, there are concerns about post-eradication manufacturing and stockpiling vaccine stores containing live virus that could escape and repopulate the environment.  Different types of polio vaccines currently exist, but none are optimal from a safety point of view.  Live attenuated (weakened) vaccine strains carry genetic mutations that prevent them from causing disease, but they can - in rare cases - revert to more dangerous virus.  There are also examples in which live attenuated virus can survive in the gut of immune-compromised individuals and can be shed into the environment through their feces.  Inactivated vaccines are themselves safe, but their production at present involves growing large amounts of wild-type (ie active virulent) virus that is then killed with a chemical called formalin.  After eradication, the World Health Organisation (WHO) plans to stop the use of live-attenuated polio vaccines.  WHO has strongly encouraged new manufacturers to switch the source of inactivated virus from virulent wild-type strains to an attenuated strain, named Sabin.  Arguing that the attenuated Sabin strain is unstable and therefore potentially problematic, Philip Minor, from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control in UK, and colleagues presented data on alternative attenuated strains which they propose as a safer alternative source for inactivated vaccine.  The researchers started with a Sabin vaccine strain whose attenuation and reversion has been extensively studied and is well understood.  Based on this knowledge, they modified a particular region of the viral RNA in ways that they predicted would make the resulting strains genetically stable.  They then compared these new strains with both the original Sabin vaccine strain and the wild-type strain currently used in the production of inactivated vaccine.  Besides testing the genetic stability of the new strains, the researchers examined their ability to grow in tissue culture (necessary for vaccine production), their risk for causing paralysis in mice carrying a human polio-virus receptor, and whether they effectively immunised rats.  Finally it was shown that these new strains were unable to infect primates by mouth. In all these tests, the new strains behaved as predicted, that is, they are effective, suitable to mass production, and safer than the alternatives.  \"We have developed new strains for IPV (Inactivated polio vaccine) production with negligible risk to the human population should they escape,\" the researchers said.  The attributes of the new strains \"allow for safe vaccine production in the post-eradication world,\" they said.  The study was published in the PLOS Pathogens.

And as the year was about to end, a media report about an audio tape containing purported conversations between senior Congress leader and former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi, his son Amit, his associates and Puneet Gupta, son-in-law of Chief Minister  Raman Singh , to allegedly \"fix\" the by-election to Antagarh (ST) seat created a furore.  Taking note, the Election Commission asked the state chief secretary to \"urgently\" institute a \"suitable enquiry\" into the issue.  Chhattisgarh Congress issued a show-cause notice to Amit and decided to wait for a report from the state unit before taking any action against Ajit Jogi since he is a member of the Congress Working Committee, the partys top decision making body.  Besides, shortfall in rains leading to drought in 117 tehsils and farmers suicides also made news in 2015.  On February 12, the ACB conducted simultaneous raids at 28 premises of the civil supplies department and unearthed disproportionate assets worth Rs 7 crore, apart from recovering cash worth over Rs 3 crore.  Cases were registered against 28 people under IPC sections 109 (abetment), 120(b) (criminal conspiracy) and other relevant sections of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.  The Raman Singh government remained busy warding off the Opposition attack over the issue as the Congress demanded a CBI probe.  Meanwhile, a series of Naxal incidents rocked the state in April, including the killing of seven Special Task Force (STF) men in Polampalli police station area of Sukma district.  On April 11, a large group of armed cadres ambushed a team of STF in Pidmel village,about 450 km from the state capital,killing seven of them.  The next day, on April 12,a BSF jawan was killed when Naxals opened indiscriminate fire on security personnel patrolling in the proximity of Chhote Baithiya Border Security Force camp under Bande police station in Kanker district.  Continuing their violent spree, on April 13, the ultras blew up an anti-landmine vehicle in Dantewada district, killing five policemen and injuring eight others.  Chhattisgarh police gunned down at least 46 rebels in 2015, as compared to 36 in 2014. As many as 18 cadres were killed alone in November.  Besides, the number of arrested cadres stood at 645 while 301 rebels surrendered in 2015. The causalities on the security forces side were reported at 44, which was 60 in 2014.

A decent pair of running shoes cost nothing less than Rs 10,000,\" Rawat told Mail Today.

Rawat's personal best of two hours, 18 minutes, six seconds at the Military Games in Korea in October was enough to ensure him a Rio berth according to the revised standards announced by the International Association of Athletics Federations.

It will lift a huge burden off my shoulders,\" he said. Rawat, who won the Delhi Half Marathon in the Indian men's elite category, is now preparing for the January 17 Mumbai Marathon. \"I am eyeing the course record (two hours 16 minutes 59 seconds) and also want to improve my personal best in that event,\" he said. Rawat, who once aspired to be cricketer, took up long distance running after trying his hand at other sports like boxing. \"I was encouraged by my superiors in the Army to take up athletics.

However, how this price shift will impact the passenger fares is not yet clear.

This should incrementally increase the pollution load.  In addition, one may see old more polluting vehicles being plied on the roads since citizens need to even their lives on odd days. Experts also fear that people who can afford may actually buy more vehicles so causing a spike in car numbers. May be the Delhi government seeks to mop up more one time lump-sum road tax collection revenues.  It is reported that the odd-even formula for rationing vehicles on roads whenever it is implemented to clean the dirty air over Paris, the city authorities in France attract the citizens to public transportation by making it free of charge.  May be the next populist measure the Aam Aadmi Party government of Delhi could implement is to make travel on the Delhi Metro and the Delhi Transport Corporation free for the days when road rationing is implemented.  As Sunita Narain of the Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi, points out that the National Capital Region (NCR) houses the countrys worst polluting Badarpur Power Station that incidentally continues to operate and ironically the countrys cleanest thermal power station located at Bawana in the NCR remains shut down since there is shortfall of Piped Natural Gas.  A drop in a few percentage points of air pollution may actually not be noticeable at all if one were to factor in weather patterns since such small variations happen on a daily basis depending on whether there is strong surface wind that dilutes the pollution by sweeping it away into the hinterland.  M Rajeevan, an atmospheric scientist and Secretary of the Ministry of Earth Sciences, New Delhi, says not enough is known quantitatively on how air pollution dilutes in the atmosphere over Delhi since the contribution of weather and wind in dispersing toxic gasses in the chaos of the tropical atmosphere over Delhi remains a mysterious unknown X-factor.  The well-intentioned thrust to control air pollution by the Delhi government may actually boomerang since the desired results of controlling air pollution may not be forthcoming since quick fix solutions tend to breakdown as easily.  Moreover, if the citizens cooperate whole-heartedly with Kejriwal and they still do not witness a perceptible drop in pollution levels, they would be highly dejected. A flagging public support would augur very badly in the long-term effort at controlling the killer air that is poisoning our lungs.  Therefore, solution to pollution is not dilution but a long-term well thought-out strengthening of the already quaking public transport system of the National Capital Region.

The new method using radio waves, called Fast Radio Bursts, is ten to hundred times better than previous testing methods that used gamma-ray bursts, researchers said.  The method is considered to be a significant tribute to Albert Einstein on the 100th anniversary of his first formulation of the Equivalence Principle, which is a key component of the theory of General Relativity.  It also is a key component of the concept that geometry of spacetime is curved by the mass density of individual galaxies, stars, planets and other objects.  Fast Radio Bursts are super-brief blasts of energy - lasting just a few milliseconds. Until now, only about a dozen Fast Radio Bursts have been detected on Earth.  They appear to be caused by mysterious events beyond our Milky Way Galaxy, and possibly even beyond the Local Group of galaxies that includes the Milky Way.  Fast Radio Bursts travel through space as waves of photon particles. The number of wave crests arriving from Fast Radio Bursts per second - their \"frequency\" - is in the same range as that of radio signals.  \"When more-powerful detectors provide us with more observations, we also will be able to use Fast Radio Bursts as a probe of their host galaxies, of the space between galaxies, of the cosmic-web structure of the universe, and as a test of fundamental physics,\" said senior author Peter Meszaros, professor at Pennsylvania State University in US.  \"If Fast Radio Bursts are proven to originate outside the Milky Way Galaxy, and if their distances can be measured accurately, they will be a new powerful tool for testing Einsteins Equivalence Principle and for extending the tested energy range down to radio-band frequencies,\" Meszaros said.  Einsteins Equivalence Principle requires that any two photons of different frequencies, emitted at the same time from the same source and travelling through the same gravitational fields, should arrive at Earth at exactly the same time.  \"If Einsteins Equivalence Principle is correct, any time delay that might occur between these two photons should not be due to the gravitational fields they experienced during their travels, but should be due only to other physical effects,\" Meszaros said.  \"By measuring how closely in time the two different-frequency photons arrive, we can test how closely they obey Einsteins Equivalence Principle,\" Meszaros said.  Meszaros said that the test involves an analysis of how much space curvature the photons experienced due to massive objects along or near their path through space.  \"Our test of Einsteins Equivalence Principle using Fast Radio Bursts consists of checking by how much does a parameter - the gamma parameter - differ for the two photons with different frequencies,\" he said.

He expressed hope that the new sedan in the pipeline will help in carrying the pace forward in 2016, even though the second half of the year gone by was challenging due to the emission cheating crisis.  He said out of the 1,23,456 units rolled out from the Chakan plant, around 72,000 were Vento sedans, 38,800 Polo compacts and 12,700 of Skoda Rapids.  Production for domestic sales grew 23 per cent to 54,140 units, and for exports rose 4 per cent to 69,300 units in 2015.  It ships Ventos to over 35 markets, with Argentina being the latest. The Pune-made Vento was showcased at the Hannover Messe in April 2015.  The Volkswagen Group, present in the country for the past 14 years, sells five passenger car brands in India -- Audi, Lamborghini, Porsche, Skoda and Volkswagen.  While the group entered the country in 2001 with Skoda, the Audi and Volkswagen brands came in 2007, with Porsche and Lamborghini brands following in 2012. Each brand operates as an independent entity here.  The Volkswagen Group India sells over 25 models through its 240 dealerships and most of the cars are assembled at its Pune and Aurangabad plants.  The Pune plant has an annual capacity of 1,30,000 units and rolls out the Polo and Vento from the Volkswagen stable and the Rapid from Skoda, while the Aurangabad plant with a capacity of 89,000 units assembles various premium and luxury models from the Audi, Skoda and Volkswagen stables.  Globally, the German giant sells thousands of models from 12 brands--Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Ducati, Lamborghini, Porsche, Scania, SEAT, Skoda, MAN, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, and Volkswagen Cars.

The move will help curtail subsidy outgo for kerosene, which in 2014-15 was about Rs 24,799 crore. \"Several state governments have come forward to implement direct benefit transfer (DBT) in kerosene in select districts,\" an official statement said. The scheme will be rolled out from April 1 in Raipur, Durg and Bilaspur in Chhattisgarh, Panipat and Panchkula in Haryana, Shimla, Solan and Una in Himachal Pradesh, Chhatra,\u00a0Giridih, East Singbhum, Hazaribagh, Jamtara and Khunti in\u00a0Jharkhand. Besides, the scheme will be implemented in Hoshangabad,\u00a0Harda, Khandwa and Burhanpur in Madhya Pradesh, Amaravati and Latur in Maharashtra, Taran Taran, Pathankot and Mohali in\u00a0Punjab and Pali, Jhunjhunu and Kota in Rajasthan. \"Where such transfer is introduced, the consumer will pay the un-subsidised price of kerosene at the time of purchase. Subsequently, the amount of subsidy will be directly transferred to the bank account of the beneficiary. \"To avoid any inconvenience to the beneficiary through payment of un-subsidised price, subsidy shall be credited to eligible beneficiaries in advance during the initial purchase,\" it said. With a view to incentivize States/UTs to implement DBT in\u00a0kerosene, it has been decided that the states be given cash incentive of 75 per cent of subsidy savings during the first two years, 50 per cent in the third year and 25 per cent in the fourth year. In case the states voluntarily agree to undertake cuts in kerosene allocation, beyond the savings due to DBT, a similar incentive will be given to those States/UTs, the statement said. \"While implementing DBT, states have been advised to take all necessary steps to ensure that eligible/genuine\u00a0beneficiaries particularly in rural areas are able to access\u00a0their full entitlement of kerosene. Special care should also\u00a0be taken in areas having irregular power supply,\" it said. Stating that the scheme will be implemented with effect from April 1, 2016, it said the state governments will be\u00a0consulted in the meantime before operationalising the scheme. The working of the scheme will also be reviewed after three months of implementation. The National Sample Survey 2011-12 indicates that the\u00a0total consumption of kerosene in the country, including both open market and PDS kerosene, was 71.30 lakh kilolitres. Even though consumption of kerosene has been coming down over the years, 86.85 lakh kilolitres of subsidized PDS kerosene has been allocated to the states in the year 2015-16, which is higher than the total household kerosene demand in the country. \"Thus, there is evidence that some part of the kerosene\u00a0allocation is diverted for non-eligible purposes,\" the\u00a0statement said. Also, there has been a major increase in coverage of power supply through electrification of villages. Nearly 45 lakh new LPG connections have also been given to the poor. These measures, it said, have reduced the demand for\u00a0kerosene, both for lighting and cooking purposes.

If so, you can put them  to the test by searching the Eastern sky for a view of a fuzzy comet on  the first day of 2016.  Comet Catalina, formally known as  \"C/2013 US10\", is currently perched in the pre-dawn skies as it returns  to the depths of space following a recent visit to the inner part of our  solar system, NASA said in a statement.  At minimum, binoculars are required to view the comet which will appear as a fuzzy envelope of ice and dust, known as a coma.  Perhaps the simplest way to find Comet Catalina is to first locate the \"Big Dipper\" in the pre-dawn sky.  Note how the handle forms a sort of \"arc\".  That \"arc\" can be followed to the orange giant star known as Arcturus  which, for those in the Northern Hemisphere,  is the second brightest  star in the sky and relatively easy to identify.  On New Year's day, the comet will pass a mere 0.5 degrees - about the width of the moon - to the west of Arcturus.  So if you head outdoors 60-90 minutes before dawn, let Arcturus serve  as your guide to find the faint, fuzzy patch of Comet Catalina.  \"Of course, for optimal viewing, it's recommended that you observe away  from streetlights and city skyglow,\" the statement read.  If you  miss Comet Catalina, don't despair. You can still be treated to an  alternate planetary extravaganza in the morning sky where Venus gleams  in the southeast.  Just before dawn on New Year's Day, Saturn will  be about eight degrees to the lower left of Venus. By January 4, the  pair will appear even closer together.  On January 6 and 7, the waning crescent moon slips by the planetary pair.  And on the morning of January 8, Venus and Saturn are separated by a mere 0.4 degrees (less than one moon-width).  The  celestial dance continues through January so that near month's end, the  five planets known as the \"ancients\" span the sky from the southeast to  the southwest in the morning twilight.

Please carry his byline and give credit to PTI) Delhis killer air: Better public transportation a solution  By Pallava Bagla  New Delhi, Jan 1 (PTI) There is no doubt that the killer air is causing a slow poisoning of Indias capital. Nevertheless, the quick fix solution to pollution is not dilution. There is no doubt that New Delhi needs to reduce its air pollution but to an analytical mind the odds that the odd-even vehicle rationing system unilaterally imposed by Chief Minister  Arvind Kejriwal  may not bring about the desired results in quantitatively controlling air pollution.  At the turn of the century when Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) was introduced on orders of the Supreme Court, the killer air over Delhi indeed cleared out, but then such a clinically radical measure was just not being attempted but a tame politically correct solution was being tried.  Ideally, the only solution is to make public transportation cheap and convenient so that Indias love affair with diesel-fired cars is curbed.  If one looks at the source apportionment study of air pollution put together by civil engineer Mukesh Sharma from IIT, Kanpur, one finds that vehicles are not the biggest culprit for causing air pollution; but dust -- mostly road and construction dust -- is the devil.  Two thirds of the particulate matter below 10 microns or PM-10 can be attributed to dust and about 40 per cent of the PM 2.5 is accounted by road dust. Vehicles at best contribute between 9-20 per cent of the PM-10 and PM-2.5 levels respectively, so vehicles are really not the worst polluters.  If one further analyses data from the IIT-Kanpur study which itself still remains a draft report and who knows how the data may change. Among the entire vehicular population of Delhi, the biggest polluters are trucks contributing about half the pollution followed by two-wheelers that contribute two-thirds of the pollution. Four wheelers contribute only a tenth of the pollution of Delhi.  To take the odd-even rationing formula a bit further at best half of the four-wheelers will be off the roads between 8 am and 8 pm in the first half of January. This should theoretically reduce the pollution load caused by four wheelers by half, but then since they are not the biggest villains to expect that the air would be cleaner really needs a quantum jump in imagination.

The findings demonstrated dietary sugars effect on an enzymatic signalling pathway known as 12-LOX (12-lipoxygenase), researchers said.  \"We found that sucrose intake in mice comparable to levels of Western diets led to increased tumour growth and metastasis, when compared to a non-sugar starch diet,\" said Peiying Yang, assistant professor at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Centre in US.  \"This was due, in part, to increased expression of 12-LOX and a related fatty acid called 12-HETE,\" said Yang.  Previous epidemiological studies have shown that dietary sugar intake has an impact on breast cancer development, with inflammation thought to play a role.  \"The current study investigated the impact of dietary sugar on mammary gland tumour development in multiple mouse models, along with mechanisms that may be involved,\" said Lorenzo Cohen, professor of Palliative, Rehabilitation and Integrative Medicine.  \"We determined that it was specifically fructose, in table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup, ubiquitous within our food system, which was responsible for facilitating lung metastasis and 12-HETE production in breast tumours,\" said Cohen.  Cohen added that the data suggested that dietary sugar induces 12-LOX signalling to increase risks for breast cancer development and metastasis.  Identifying risk factors for breast cancer is a public health priority, researchers said.  \"Prior research has examined the role of sugar, especially glucose, and energy-based metabolic pathways in cancer development,\" said Yang.  \"However, the inflammatory cascade may be an alternative route of studying sugar-driven carcinogenesis that warrants further study,\" Yang said.  The team conducted four different studies in which mice were randomised to different diet groups and fed one of four diets.  At six months of age, 30 per cent of mice on a starch-control diet had measurable tumours, whereas 50 to 58 per cent of the mice on sucrose-enriched diets had developed mammary tumours.  The study also showed that numbers of lung metastases were significantly higher in mice on a sucrose- or a fructose-enriched diet, versus mice on a starch-control diet.  \"This study suggests that dietary sucrose or fructose induced 12-LOX and 12-HETE production in breast tumour cells in vivo,\" said Cohen.  \"This indicates a possible signalling pathway responsible for sugar-promoted tumour growth in mice. How dietary sucrose and fructose induces 12-HETE and whether it has a direct or indirect effect remains in question,\" Cohen added.  The study was published in the journal Cancer Research.

The 15-year cycle of the anti-poverty Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) came to an end with 2015 paving the way for the SDGs, an even more ambitious set of goals to banish a host of social ills by 2030.  \"The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are our shared vision of humanity and a social contract between the worlds leaders and the people,\" UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had said of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted unanimously by 193 Heads of State and other top leaders at a summit here in September.  \"They are a to-do list for people and planet, and a blueprint for success,\" he had said of the 17 goals and 169 targets to wipe out poverty, fight inequality and tackle climate change over the next 15 years.  The official ushering in of the new 15-year cycle takes place over a 24-hour period, coming into effect in each region of the planet at the stroke of midnight Thursday.  India is seen as critical for the success of the SDGs, given that improving the lives of 1.4 billion Indians would make a major dent in the goal of improving the lives of all humanity. Even before the SDGs came into effect, India told the UN that it is already implementing the new goals in the form of several initiatives launched by the Indian government.  \"We believe that the SDGs are in themselves a strong endorsement of the developmental vision articulated by the Indian government under the leadership of Prime Minister  Narendra Modi ,\" India had said on the adoption of the outcome document of the Agenda 2030 at the final session of intergovernmental negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda in August.  \"In fact, most if not all the initiatives launched by Prime Minister Modi can be related to one or more of the SDGs. In this sense, the SDGs are already being implemented in India,\" it said.  Ambitious programmes launched by the Indian government like Make in India, Digital India, Smart Cities and the Skills India initiative aim at boosting economic development and manufacturing in the country and help lift millions out of poverty.

The most encouraging piece of news for the state came in November-December when the Hero World Hockey league finals was hosted at the newly-built Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel International Hockey Stadium in the capital Raipur.  The event featured eight national hockey teams from all over the world, including India.  The year 2015 also brought cheer to cricket lovers as the Raipur-based international stadium hosted two matches of Indian Premier League in May.  In May, the visit of Prime Minister  Narendra Modi  to the strife-torn Dantewada district became the talking point when around 500 villagers were held hostage by the rebels on the day of his tour to Tongpal area of neighbouring Sukma opposing the construction of a bridge on a river in the area.  Later, a local villager who was supervising construction work on the river was killed even as the others were released by the rebels.  Controversies continued in state politics with the BJP government coming under attack from Opposition Congress over several issues, including content in class X textbooks, a fake candidate allegedly appearing in a post-graduation exam of a open universityas proxy for state Education Minister Kedar Kashyaps wife Shanti in Bastar district and farmers suicide.  The textbook of social science published by Chhattisgarh Board of Secondary Education stated that the ratio of unemployment of men increased after Independence because women have started working in all sectors. However, Kashyap immediately ordered withdrawal of the controversial contents and directed an inquiry into the matter.  Due to scanty rainfall, the state government declared 117 tehsils asdrought-affected and launched a number of relief works for farmers.  Congress claimed that 25 farmers had committed suicide across the state following Kharif crop failure. However, the state government said family disputes and alcoholism led to the suicides by farmers at some places.  Taking a cue from Modis endeavour to interact with people through Mann ki Baat, Chief Minister Singh started to communicate with people in the state through radio every month in a programme named Raman Ke Goth, that also grabbed national media attention.  The other stories that drew all-round appreciation were the researches on new varieties of rice at Indira Gandhi Agriculture University here. A zinc-enriched variety of rice was developed by scientists at the university that will play a crucial role in fighting malnutrition. The varsity also identified ahigh-yielding variety of white rice with low Glycemic Index (GI).

Kumar also warned that the nation would disintegrate if \"monolithic culture\" developed in the country and said Socialists would be always in the forefront to fight the challenges posed by these forces.  Kumar also suggested that some collaborative moves were necessary to fight communalism rising above Front politics.

PWF would follow such a method, he added.  PWF members were later slated to meet TMC leader G K Vasan, he said.  On the recent incident of DMDK leader Vijayakants alleged indecent behaviour with journalists, he said it could have been avoided.  Taking a dig at the ruling BJP at the Centre, he said the party had not implemented its promises even as he slammed incidents of alleged intolerance, including the killing of rationalists like Narendra Dabholkar.  Vaiko said the party paid the price in the Bihar election which it lost.

Ironically though Waqar had given his availability for the PSL in the head coaches list no franchise opted for him even though the Peshawar franchise opted to pick his junior Muhammad Akram and Quetta went for former captain Moin Khan. The other three franchises have opted for foreign coaches. Sources said that Waqar was miffed with the way he was ignored by PSL franchises and had conveyed his frustration to the cricket board which is holding the PSL. Some former players have made a big issue of the fact that Pakistan's head coach couldn't find a place in the PSL and how Younis Khan was also ignored.

Pakistan Cricket Board included Aamir in the ODI and T20 squads for the away series against New Zealand, giving him a lifeline to make amends for his spot-fixing act in 2010. Aamir though admitted that making a comeback against an aggressive Kiwi outfit will not be easy. \"If I get a chance to play in New Zealand it will not be easy bowling to this (changed) approach but mentally I am prepared for a hard comeback,\" Aamir told PTI. Knowing the divide in Pakistan cricket regarding his international return, Aamir, whose visa process also remains uncertain with the team leaving for New Zealand on January 10, admits that winning back the favour of one and all will not be easy. \"One thing is clear to me I will have to perform really well to win back the confidence of my fans. I am sure they are behind me and I will not let them down,\" the 23-year old said.   A PCB official said legal information with regard to Aamirs conviction and departure from the United Kingdom has been submitted with the New Zealand consulate. The official also informed that if response is positive than Aamirs visa application will be filed with the consulate when it reopens after Christmas and New Year holidays on Monday. Aamir, who served a five-year ban and jail time for indulging in spot-fixing during the 2010 tour of England, also admitted that he has been lucky to get a second chance in the game and understands the feelings of his critics.   \"I feel bad because of their (critics) strong comments, but it is their opinion the best I can do is repay the faith and support those who feel I should get another chance to play again for Pakistan have shown in me,\" he said. Aamirs spot fixing ban expired last September but the ICC gave him special permission to resume playing domestic cricket earlier in April 2015. \"I know cricket especially ODIs and T20s have undergone changes and the attitude of batsmen is very different now. So it is going to be a big challenge getting back into this mould. But the good thing is that I have followed cricket and other teams closely in the last one year,\" he said.

BJP vehemently opposed Sami while in opposition.

Maharashtra Navnirman Chitrapat Karmachari Sena, the film wing of the Raj Thackeray-led MNS, had in 2013 asked the Pakistani singer to leave the country as he was allegedly staying in India without a visa.

Lahore-born Sami had first arrived in India on March 13, 2001 on a visitors visa with the validity of one year which was issued by the Indian High Commission in Islamabad.  His visa was extended from time to time. His Pakistani passport issued on May 27, 2010 expired on May 26, 2015 and his passport was not renewed by the Pakistan government which led him to approach the Indian government with the request to legalise his stay in India.

Speaking at the inaugural function of the 139th birthday of its founder and social reformer Mannath Padmanabhan at Perunna in Changanassery near here, he said NSS would help those parties which approach it with all humility.  His statement assumes significance in wake of BJP trying to woo various Hindu outfits in the state to back it ahead of Assembly polls scheduled early this year.  The saffron party has successfully reached out to the leadership of Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP) headed by Vellappally Natesan.  Natesan, who floated a new party Bharat Dharma Jana Sena last month by organising various Hindu caste organisations in Kerala, had invited NSS to associate with it.  But NSS outrightly rejected the Eazhava community leaders invitation, saying it could not be made party to \"somebodys selfish move\".  Addressing NSS leaders today, Nair asked the BJP leaders to \"control\" those in the party leadership who try to target the NSS for political purposes.  \"BJP should not try to interfere in the internal matters of NSS,\" Nair said and asked the BJP leaders to learn from Congress-led UDF and the CPI (M)-led LDF in this regard.  \"NSS does not side with any political party. BJP leaders should learn about NSS,\" he said, adding that it was only a small section of BJP leaders see NSS as an enemy.  He was apparently referring to a section of BJP members belonging to the Nair community and opposed to his leadership trying to capture NSS Karayogams (village level units).  Some karayogams, in which BJP members are in majority, had even passed resolutions against his leadership on various issues.

Somaiya said he will work towards getting rid of such fraudulent schemes, which mostly offer high returns within a short period of time, in 2016 and expose those who are operating them.  Blaming SEBI for failing to take timely action against Samrudha Jeevan and Sai Prasad - both Ponzi investment firms - in December 2010, Somaiya claimed the size of alleged fraud committed by the two entities would have been restricted to Rs 500 crore instead of Rs 7,000 crore now.  The BJP leader said he had brought the issue to the notice of then Congress-NCP Government in Maharashtra.  \"In November 2012, I had spoken to then Home Minister R R Patil about the fraudulent methods of Sai Prasad scheme. However, action against Sai Prasad was taken only in December 2015,\" he said.  Somaiya claimed more than 200 small and medium size Ponzi schemes are still operating in the country involving Rs 4,00,000 crore. Of these, Rs 2,00,000 crore is in schemes like Sai Prasad and Samrudha Jeevan.  \"Mahesh Motewar, who raised Rs 278 crore from farmers on behalf of Prosperity Agro, invested it in private news television channels and used them to promote his Ponzi schemes despite SEBI banning Samrudha Jeevan in 2013,\" he said.  Motewar is Chairman of Pune-based collective investment scheme company Samrudha Jeevan Foods India, which is mired in chit fund scam.  Giving a list of 193 Ponzi companies, he said of these 165 operate in Maharashtra. He urged people not to fall prey to allurement of quick gains in short time.  The BJP MP from Mumbai North-East also spoke about suburban train services in the metropolis.  \"As many as 500 new coaches will be introduced this year. Besides this, the height of 93 platforms in the suburban section shall be raised.

The tournament will serve the dual purpose for cricketers vying for top honours. For India internationals like comeback men Yuvraj and Nehra, along with fringe players, it will be a testing ground where they can stake claim for a berth in the team for ICC World T20 in March. For those plying their trade in domestic cricket, Mushtaq Ali T20 trophy will give them a platform to impress the various franchises with their skills before the big IPL auction in February. The BCCI, in a positive step, has decided to hold Mushtaq Ali T20 keeping the World T20 in mind. The tournament over years had lost significance for being conducted hastily just before Indian Premier League. With auctions over, the domestic talents did not get an opportunity to land IPL contracts. Punjab skipper Harbhajan and Yuvraj will be fighting it out against Rajasthan at Kochi while Nehra, who made a comeback into the Indian team after four and half years, will be getting himself battle ready with Delhi taking on Railways. After being selected in the Indian T20 team, he would certainly like some match simulation before boarding the flight to Australia. For Yuvraj and Nehra, the additional incentive would be to impress the franchise owners as they are both without any IPL team. Another person who must be wanting to prove a point would be Suresh Raina, who got an ODI snub after a long time. Rainas Uttar Pradesh will take on Maharashtra at Cuttack. It will be after 19 long years that a Bengal team would be without the talismanic all-rounder Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who announced his retirement from competitive cricket, as they take on Hyderabad in Nagpur.

It was a roller-coaster ride for the stock market in 2015 where the benchmark Sensex lost 1,381.88 points or 5 per cent, after gaining nearly 30 per cent in 2014. The index had last registered an yearly loss in 2011 when it fell 24 per cent. It also came off sharply after peaking above 30,000-points mark, a milestone it crossed in March but could not retain. Listing out the markets wishlist for the new year, Bonanza Portfolios Associate Fund Manager Hiren Dhakan said, \"GST Bill being passed in the Parliament, further rate cuts by RBI, stable Indian rupee against the US dollar, no further devaluation of Chinese Yuan, normal monsoon, fresh policy measures by the government to promote foreign investment and stable oil prices.\" GST, which seeks to simplify and harmonise the indirect tax regime across the country with a single uniform rate, has been stuck for a long time in a political gridlock. \"Passage of the GST bill is likely to be the priority for the government in the new year. Government spending towards infrastructure and ease of doing business will be other wish list which will be keenly watched. As inflation trajectory continues to be low we can expect 2-3 more rate cut decision by RBI during the later part of 2016,\" said Vinod Nair, Head Fundamental Research, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services. \"As far as FIIs flow is concerned, world liquidity hunts for the best opportunities in the market and India is amongst the finest economies in the EMs available at fair valuation,\" Nair said. Last year also saw the worst single-day performance by the Sensex on August 24 when it fell sharply by 1,624.51 points or 5.94 per cent triggered by a Chinese rout. Delay in key reforms including GST, global headwinds and uncertainty about an interest rate hike in the US, had kept the markets on the edge in 2015. \"Passing of key reform bills like Goods and Services Tax (GST), increased capital expenditure by companies, increase in inflow of foreign money, good monsoon, improved macro-economic condition, improvement in consumption demand, strengthening of rupee against dollar,\" said Gaurav Jain, Director of Hem Securities.

As the clock struck eight this morning, the vehicular restriction policy came into effect with thousands of volunteers carrying roses also taking to the streets to assist traffic police in enforcing the pilot plan that will stay in force till January 15.  \"Overwhelmed\" by the response of the people to the car rationing experiment, Delhi Chief Minister  Arvind Kejriwal  said that the pilot initiative of the AAP government has turned \"into a movement\".  Cars bearing odd-numbered registration plates shall ply on city roads today while those with even number plates, if taken out, will attract a penalty of Rs 2,000 under relevant sections of the Motor Vehicles Act. It will be vice-versa tomorrow.  200 teams of Traffic Police, 66 enforcement teams of transport department and 40 teams of sub-divisional magistrates were deployed across the city to ensure strict implementation of the scheme which is stipulated till 8 PM on week days.  Even as the scheme was unveiled, the air quality continued to remain very poor with areas of the city including the Delhi Secretariat complex recording severe level of pollutants in real time.  An additional 3,000 buses have been deployed in the city as part of efforts to augment public transport. The metro has also decided to run 70 extra trips.  The Chief Minister said that as per initial reports, the plan has been \"quite successful\" and people in the national capital have largely accepted the restrictions with an \"open mind\".  \"I repeatedly said that the scheme will meet with success only when people embrace it and not though force. It has become a movement and we are truly overwhelmed by the response we have received so far.  \"Delhi will show the way to the rest of the country,\" Kejriwal told reporters outside his residence.  However, the real test of the schemes effectiveness will be on Moday as a number of private offices are closed today. Also the schools are having winter vacation, which would have taken off some load from the traffic.

Pakistan army chief General Raheel Sharif confirmed the death sentences of nine men convicted by military courts, an Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) statement said, three days after Pakistan executed four militants involved in suicide bombing, slaughtering of people and attacks on soldiers.  The men termed as \"hardcore terrorists\" by ISPR were sentenced for offences relating to terrorism, including an attack on the Parade Lane mosque, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Headquarters in Multan, attacks on law enforcement agencies (LEAs) and kidnapping and murder of civilians in Lahore.  The terrorists whose death sentences have been confirmed included Muhammad Ghauri, Abdul Qayyum and Aksan Mehboob.  Ghauri, an active member of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and TTP media cell in-charge, was involved in the attack on Parade Lane Mosque, Rawalpindi, in which 38 people were killed and 57 injured. He admitted his offences before a magistrate and trial court. He was tried on four charges and awarded a death sentence, the statement said.  Also sentenced were Harkatul Jehad-e-Islam activist Qayyum, who was involved in the attack on ISI Headquarters, Multan, in which seven people were killed and 72 injured. He was tried on seven charges and awarded the death sentence.  Mehboob, an active member of al-Qaeda, was also convicted for involvement in attacks on LEAs with fire-arms, killing and injuring soldiers. He admitted his offences before a magistrate and trial court. He was tried on four charges and awarded a death sentence.  Another terrorist named Imran was sentenced for involvement in terrorist acts and attacks on LEAs, killing and injuring civilians and soldiers.  Five other terrorists -- members of the Sunni sectarian outfit Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan -- who had killed five Shiites in the eastern city of Lahore, were also sentenced to death.  Military courts were set up in Pakistan to expedite the trial process for terror-related offences following the December 2014 Talibans massacre at an army-run school in Peshawar in which over 150 people, mostly school children, were killed.  Following the attack, the government had lifted the moratorium on the death penalty and the Parliament passed the 21st amendment which established military courts which was challenged in the Supreme Court. The apex court ruled in favour of setting up of the courts in August last year.

Staying the single bench order, Justices Tashi Rabstan and Bansi Lal Bhat issued notices to the relevant parties returnable within four weeks after which the bench will hear the arguments on the case.  The stay order of division bench came after a petition was moved by National Secretary of BJP Farooq Khan challenging the single bench order passed by Justice Hasnain Masoodi upholding a government circular which asked all constitutional authorities to hoist the state flag with national flag atop their official buildings and vehicles.  Khan, an IPS officer and former Inspector General of Police, had contended that no flag could have the same place as that of the national tri-colour.  After hearing the arguments, the division bench issued \"notices returnable within a period of four weeks and notice in the MP (Memorandum of Parties) also returnable within the same period and Called for the writ record.  \"Meanwhile, subject to objections, operation of impugned judgment shall stay,\" the court said in the order.  The development triggered a political storm with former Chief Minister  Omar Abdullah  attacking Chief Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed saying if he cannot defend the states dignity and flag from the \"nefarious\" plans of his ally BJP \"he should step down and find someone who can\" defend it.  BJP, which is an ally of the PDP, has had a stand of ek vidhan, ek nishan, ek pradhan (One Constitution, One Flag, One leader).  The CPI(M) said hoisting of two flags on all government buildings and vehicles is constitutionally valid in the state.  CPI(M) leader Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami said,\"Attempts are being made by the BJP to rake up an unwarranted controversy over state flag and Article 370 and that is why it has challenged the single bench judgment on the subject, despite having no locus to challenge the same.\"  It is also unfortunate that the state government has not fulfilled its responsibility of contesting the arguments of the BJP that has facilitated a stay order on the recent court judgement on the subject, he said.

In the newly revamped structure, Chinas powerful missile force, the Second Artillery Corps (SAC) which was formed in 1966 has been renamed as Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) Rocket Force (PRF) and announced the formation of PLA Strategic Support Force (SSF).  With a variety of short-, medium- and long-range nuclear and conventional missiles, Chinas missile force is regarded as one of the biggest in the world.  Yesterday, China confirmed reports of PLA conducting scientific tests of a railcar-based long-range missile capable of hitting targets across the US.

It will be a key milestone in the modernisation of the Chinese military and will be recorded in the history of the peoples armed forces, said Xi who is also the general secretary of the CPC.

The singer, against whom a lookout notice was earlier issued for not presenting himself before police despite two summons in connection with the case, today alleged that kin of the girl are trying to \"extort\" money from him.  The plea also stated that the singer is a native of Goa but has acquired Portuguese nationality and currently possesses a Portuguese passport.  \"The complaint filed by Aires Rodrigues is in connivance with the family of the injured and one or two individuals from Goa and Sindudurgh, who will be exposed soon,\" Remo told PTI minutes after arriving in Goa.  The singer said he had full faith in judiciary and will not \"succumb\" to the \"extortion demand\".  Rodrigues, a social activist, had filed the complaint against Remo for verbally abusing the 17-year-old girl at Goa Medical College and Hospital where she was admitted after allegedly being hit by a car driven by his son Johan on December 2.  Remo said in his plea that he had met the victim at the Goa Medical College on December 3 after the accident and offered to pay Rs 50,000 for treatment and travel.  \"But to the horror and surprise, the younger sister of the injured (girl)in a very rude and impolite manner, began demanding that the Applicant should pay nothing short of Rs 3 lakh at the moment,\" the petition read.  Remo said he was tired of \"keeping silent\" on the issue on advice of his previous lawyer, as the matter was sub-judice, and has replaced his lawyer.  \"I changed my lawyer to the very able advocate Rajeev Gomes. (I) returned to Goa this morning on finishing my professional and personal commitments in Europe earlier than planned, and am on a war footing to expose the fabrications and lies which have been spread about me by Aires Rodrigues and others,\" he said.  In his intervention application filed through his lawyer in the court on December 29, Remo had stated that he has in Europe and is making all efforts to present himself before the police by January 8, his scheduled arrival date in Goa.

The Centre cleared the proposal of the state government which was submitted in early 2012 by the then  Omar Abdullah  government.  \"The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has enhanced the honorarium of Special Police Officers (SPOs) of Jammu and Kashmir upto Rs 6,000 per month from Rs 3,000 per month. The enhancement of honorarium will come into effect from today,\" an official statement said.  The state has 25,827 SPOs against the sanctioned strength of 30,000.  The honorarium is given by the state government and reimbursed by the Central government under the Security Related Expenditure (SRE) scheme.  The last enhancement was done in 2006. It is expected that this will boost the morale of the SPOs who play a vital role in combating militancy in the state.  Giving approval to the proposal, Home Minister  Rajnath Singh  has also constituted a committee comprising representatives of Home Ministry and state government for assessing the performance, utility and efficacy of the SPOs.  When the proposal for enhancement of honorarium was mooted in 2012, it was in-principle agreed by the then Home Minister P Chidambaram.  However, the Finance Ministry had put the proposal in cold storage citing fund crunch as one of the reasons.  The SPOs, who show exemplary works, are promoted as followers or constables.  The SPOs were recruited in police force at the peak of trouble in the state and proved very effective in dealing with the militancy due to their local knowledge and intelligence network.  Many of the SPOs were former militants who surrendered before the authorities and later helped them combat militancy.

The increase would have been higher than $8 billion if not for valuation gains from the appreciation of the   US dollar  against the rupee and most major currencies, estimated at $5.7 billion.   \"Excluding the valuation effect, the increase in debt would have been higher by $13.7 billion at end-September 2015 over the end-March 2015 level,\" the   finance ministry  said in a report. Sequentially, external debt declined by $291 million from the level at the end of June.   \"Benefitting from the valuation effect, external debt in USD terms recorded a decline in sequential quarters at end-September 2015 after a gap of nine quarters,\" said Aditi Nayar, a senior economist at ICRA. \"Nevertheless, the vulnerability assessed by indicators such as the coverage provided by   foreign exchange  reserves, external debt to   GDP  and the proportion of short-term debt within total external debt worsened at end-September 2015 relative to end-June 2015.\"    Foreign exchange reserves provided cover for 72.5% of the country's external debt compared with 71.9% in March.   \"The government will continue to focus on monitoring long- and short-term debt, raising sovereign loans on concessional terms with longer maturities, regulating external commercial borrowings through end-use and rationalising   interest rates  on NRI deposits,\" the ministry said. The share of commercial borrowings in India's external debt was the highest at 37.7%, followed by NRI deposits (25.2%) and multilateral debt (11%).   Earlier this year, the Reserve Bank of India relaxed guidelines to help Indian companies raise funds in rupees from overseas lenders. The move was aimed at shifting the   forex  risk to lenders and ease pressure on foreign exchange reserves if the rupee depreciates.

Indian textile exporters have reported that the buyers or companies based in the US supplying to their government departments and agencies have halted sourcing raw materials from countries like India, which are not part of the General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule Contract.  The GSA is responsible for supporting several federal agencies in the US with basic functions, including procurement services.  Pursuant to the Buy American Act, the US federal acquisition process is based on preferential treatment of US-made products. Manufacturers are considered as US products if manufactured domestically and the cost of local components is more than 50 per cent of the overall cost of all components.  Under certain conditions however, the Buy American Act may be waived. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (TAA) gives the President authority to waive Buy American Act requirements for certain procurements. So far it has been waived for eligible products in acquisitions covered by the WTO Government Procurement Agreement, some relevant free trade agreements (FTA), as well as for least-developed countries.  As per the TAA, all products listed on the GSA Schedule Contract be manufactured or \"substantially transformed\" in a \"designated country\".  The designated countries, as per the GSA Schedule, consist of World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement Countries, Countries having Free Trade Agreement with the US, Least Developed Countries and Countries based in the Caribbean-Basin.  As India does not fit into any of these criteria, the US-based buyers have stopped their sourcing from our textile manufacturers immediately, impacting the order books and the production lines of some of the major exporters, Ficci said.

ASBA facility has become mandatory for all categories of investors applying for a public issue for making payment from today.  The facility allows the bid amount to remain in the applicants account till the time the shares are finally alloted.  In a circular, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said that the application form for ASBA would be printed in a booklet form of A4 size paper.  Besides, Sebi has prescribed white color form for Resident Indian, NRIs applying on a non repatriation basis and blue color form for NRIs, Foreign Venture Capital Investor, Foreign Institutional Investors, their Sub-Accounts (other than sub-accounts which are foreign corporates or foreign individuals bidding under the QIB Portion), on a repatriation basis.  It further said that top of the application form will have a colored identifier strap incorporating the name of the issuer, ISIN (An International Securities Identification Number) and type of form (Repatriation, Non-Repatriation).  Besides, the main application should have information about eight digit application number, PAN number, bidders depository account details, investor category, among others.  A confirmation by the applicant (on behalf of joint bidders) that he/she has read, understood and agrees to such confirmations is also required.  The regulator said that application should also highlight about different category of investors (retail, non institutional and QIBs), number of equity shares (reservation if applicable), percentage of issue available for allotment, basis of allocation in case of over-subscription, mode of allotment and terms of payment.  The new circular will be applicable for all public issues opening on or after January 1, 2016, Sebi said.  The regulator, in August, had made ASBA facility mandatory for all categories of investors applying for a public issue.  In order to enhance the points for submission of applications, Sebi had also allowed Registrar and Share Transfer Agents (RTAs) and Depository Participants (DPs) to accept application forms (both physical as well as online) and make bids on the stock exchange platform.

I think it is important that for short periods of time, such plans must be implemented in order to change peoples? behaviour. It cannot be kept permanently there but for 15 days from time to time.

Congress has been critical of the move on the ground that it has been brought without putting in place the requisite arrangements to ease the woes of commuters.  Asked about the problems to commuters due to the new formula, Chidambaram acknowledged that it will cause some problems.  \"But the point is it is intended to change peoples? behaviour. If I am a person who has not travelled on Metro, this may persuade me to change my behaviour and travel by Metro twice a week. The idea is to change peoples? behaviour,\" he said.  Partys Communication department chief Randeep Surjewala, who had on Wednesday asked whether it was an \"off-the-cuff decision\" to avoid media attention from the 400 per cent salary hike of Delhi MLAs, today insisted that \"Congress was never opposed to the plan in principle.\"  He, however, raised questions on whether the ambitious plan can be implemented when there is \"an atmosphere of distrust, acrimony and bitterness\" between Centre and the state government.\"  He also posed a number of questions before the AAP government of Delhi and the NDA dispensation at the Centre regarding their initiatives to check other means of pollution and their preparedness to put alternative arrangements in place.

A probe by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) found that there was transfer of funds between the client bank account maintained by Anand Rathi Share and bank accounts of Anand Rathi Commodities.  Anand Rathi Commodities is a group company of Anand Rathi Share, which deals in commodities market.  The markets regulator said that Anand Rathi Share has completely stopped the practice of funds transfer of clients across the company of Anand Rathi Share to Anand Rathi Commodities since April 21, 2014 and it has even changed its inter-segment and inter-company transfer of funds policy.  In the present case, Sebi said there were 21,198 instances amounting to Rs 220 crore of transfer of funds (payments and receipts) between Anand Rathi Shares client bank account and Anand Rathi Commodities during the financial year 2012-13.  Out of these fund transfers, there were a total of 11,220 instances, amounting to Rs 119 crore, of payments made from Anand Rathi Shares client bank account to Anand Rathi Commodities.  In 9,973 cases, a total of Rs 101 crore were received in Anand Rathi Shares client bank account from Anand Rathi Commodities.  The brokerage firm said that funds were transferred from/to commodities account to securities account to facilitate the client and fulfill his obligation in respective segment for the ease of operation to client who was trading across various segments.  The markets watchdog Sebi said that Anand Rathi Share has followed the practice of transfer of funds between commodities and securities broking companies on a frequent and regular basis.  \"If argument put forward by the notice (Anand Rathi Share) that the said transfers are executed with clients consent is accepted, it will also convey a wrong message to the market participants that this practice has been regularised. This may also have wider implications from systemic point of view,\" Sebi said in an order.  By indulging in such activities, Anand Rathi Share has failed to exercise due skill and care in conduct of its business and has failed to comply with statutory requirements under Sebi (Stock-Brokers & Sub-Brokers) Regulations.  Accordingly, Sebi has imposed a \"monetary penalty of Rs 30 lakh on the noticee which will be commensurate with the default committed by it.\" PTI SP STS", "section": "Finance", "topics": {"BUSINESS PROFIT AND LOSS": 0.11627906976744186, "TAX AND SERVICES": 0.6511627906976745, "STOCK MARKET": 0.11627906976744186, "INTERNATIONAL ENTERTAINMENT, INTERNATIONAL CELEBRITIES": 0.023255813953488372, "POLITICAL PARTY, POLITICAL LEADER": 0.023255813953488372}, "day": 1}

The stone was laid by Union Road Transport and Highways Minister  Nitin Gadkari .  Parrikar, former Chief Minister of Goa, said if the odd-even formula were to be implemented in the coastal state, the tourists will have to be stopped at the state border itself before allowed entry.  \"We will have to tell them (tourists) that come with even number plates inside and next day change it to odd (number plates),\" he added.  Delhi Government today rolled out its ambitious odd-even scheme, which is aimed at mitigating spiralling air pollution levels in the city, wherein private cars bearing odd and even number plates ply alternately on city roads.  Parrikar said the third bridge across Mandovi river, which is under construction in Panaji, would divert almost 60 per cent of traffic, and that the entire project would be completed by March next year.  He said the Modi-led government is committed to develop infrastructure in Goa.  \"If state government comes up with proper proposals, the Modi-led government will sanction projects worth Rs 15,000 to 20,000 crore during five years of its rule,\" he said.

But since the time Modi government was sworn in, we have received projects worth Rs 5,000 crore which amounts to 40 per cent of the total state budget,\" he said.

The exchanges would need to take steps for maintaining of 51 percentage of shareholding of Public Category and ensuring that holding of trading members, associates or agents does not exceed 49 per cent.  Leading exchange BSE has been seeking to get listed for a long time, but its plans have been hanging in balance due to lack of regulatory clearances. Sebi had first announced its norms for listing of bourses over three years ago.  The capital markets watchdog has been of the view that necessary safeguards need to be first put in place for tackling conflict of interest and other issues.  In a circular, Sebi said the listed stock exchange will have to disseminate the details of its shareholding with category wise breakup on a continuous basis, on its website.  Similarly, the bourse where the shares are listed, shall also display this information.  Besides, depositories will have to put in place systems for capturing the shareholding data of trading members or their associates and agents and ensure that there is a mechanism for coordination between the depositories towards sharing of information.  A mechanism would need to be put in place providing for approval of the listed stock exchange as and when holding of trading members/associates/agents reaches 45 per cent.  In case they purchase shares without requisite approval, the depositories will initiate consequential action such as freezing of voting rights and all corporate benefits in respect of such stake till the time the same is divested.  The divestment of any excess shareholding beyond the specified limit would be through a special window provided by the stock exchange.  The new norms provide that to ensure compliance that every shareholder be Fit and Proper, all applicant in the IPO or Offer For Sale will be required to make declaration to this effect at the time of making application.  The listed stock exchange will have to submit an exceptional report regarding the shareholders who are not fit and proper and action taken thereof on a quarterly basis.  Sebi will also issue necessary procedures to ensure compliance of the provisions post listing. The shareholding threshold of 2 per cent, 5 per cent or 15 per cent (for different classes of investors) as the case may be, will be monitored through Depository mechanism.  \"The depositories shall put in place a mechanism to ensure that no shareholder of listed stock exchange gets credit of shares beyond 5 per cent or 15 per cent, as applicable,\" the regulator said in a circular.  The depositories shall generate an alert when such holding exceeds 2 per cent and monitor the same under intimation to Sebi, it added.  The stock exchanges, both listed and where the securities are listed, and depositories will have to ensure that such mechanism be in place latest by March 31, 2016.

Speaking at the inaugural function of the 139th birthday of its founder and social reformer Mannath Padmanabhan at Perunna in Changanassery near here, he said NSS would help those parties which approach it with all humility.  His statement assumes significance in wake of BJP trying to woo various Hindu outfits in the state to back it ahead of Assembly polls scheduled early this year.  The saffron party has successfully reached out to the leadership of Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP) headed by Vellappally Natesan.  Natesan, who floated a new party Bharat Dharma Jana Sena last month by organising various Hindu caste organisations in Kerala, had invited NSS to associate with it.  But NSS outrightly rejected the Eazhava community leaders invitation, saying it could not be made party to \"somebodys selfish move\".  Addressing NSS leaders today, Nair asked the BJP leaders to \"control\" those in the party leadership who try to target the NSS for political purposes.  \"BJP should not try to interfere in the internal matters of NSS,\" Nair said and asked the BJP leaders to learn from Congress-led UDF and the CPI (M)-led LDF in this regard.  \"NSS does not side with any political party. BJP leaders should learn about NSS,\" he said, adding that it was only a small section of BJP leaders see NSS as an enemy.  He was apparently referring to a section of BJP members belonging to the Nair community and opposed to his leadership trying to capture NSS Karayogams (village level units).  Some karayogams, in which BJP members are in majority, had even passed resolutions against his leadership on various issues.

The Engineering Exports Promotion Council (EEPC) said that despite a 7-8 per cent depreciation in rupee against dollar during 2015, shipments in 2015-16 will be confined to USD 60-62 billion.  In 2014-15, engineering exports had aggregated over USD 70 billion.  Engineering exports, which account for about 23 per cent of the countrys total merchandise exports, dropped 14.4 per cent to USD 39.85 billion during April?November from USD 46.55 billion during the same period last year.  \"There is no question of engineering sector reaching the last years level of USD 70 billion in FY16. We may end the year with shipments around USD 60-62 billion with a hope that things start changing for better in the next financial year,\" EEPC India Chairman TS Bhasin said.  Primary iron and steel, along with all non-ferrous metals and products, which contribute the maximum to the engineering export basket, saw a real bloodbath in the export market, leaving absolutely no pricing power with the producers, he said.  The primary iron and steel exports have fallen by more than 28 per cent in November 2015 against the corresponding month in 2014, while the fall has been over 40 per cent for the products segment.  For the April-November period, the aggregate drop in these two areas has been over 25 per cent.  \"All non ferrous metals and products, barring tin and products made of tin, witnessed deterioration in exports during November 2015. Another segment which has been a huge de-growth during the year is the railways transport,\" Bhasin said.  \"Exports in this segment (railway transport) declined by 44 per cent for the April-November period. Be it auto and auto components, air conditioners and refrigerators or medical or scientific instruments, there has been a sharp fall in the export consignments, dealing a deadly blow to the engineering sectors,\" Bhasin said.

The animosity that emerged over the appointment of Shakuntala Gamlin as the acting Chief Secretary by the Lt Governor, against the ruling AAPs opinion, turned full circle with the CBI raids at the Delhi Secretariat in December and the ensuing political firestorm.  As the conflict raged on, words flew thick and fast, often lowering the quality of public discourse, and both sides exchanged letters, claiming rightful authority over administrative jurisdiction.  As matters came to a head over the appointment of Swati Maliwal as Delhi Commission for Women chief (DCW) in July, Lt Governor Najeeb Jung proclaimed, \"In respect to the NCT (national capital territory) of Delhi the Government means the Lieutenant Governor of the NCT of Delhi.\"  Steps towards fulfilling key poll promises like slashing water and power tariff, passing the Jan Lokpal Bill and a set of radical measures to combat the growing menace of air pollution under public and judicial pressure would also count among the focal points of the Kejriwal government.  The government announced a series of radical measures to mitigate rising pollution in the city, chief among them the introduction of the odd-even policy, under which vehicles bearing odd and even registration plates plied on alternate days starting today.  The first standoff occurred within days of Jung appointing senior bureaucrat Gamlin as acting Chief Secretary of the city government in June, in the temporary absence of K K Sharma, notwithstanding strong reservations by the Kejriwal dispensation which termed the decision as \"unconstitutional\".  Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) became another sticking point with the body being headed by two simultaneous heads at one point, LG-appointed M K Meena and the other, S S Yadav, authorised by the AAP government.  Kejriwal accused Prime Minister  Narendra Modi  of taking over the anti-graft body using \"paramilitary\" personnel on June 8, which he said was aimed at weakening AAPs fight against corruption.  The genesis of the faceoff over CBI raids at the Delhi Secretariat, at the fag end of the year, lay in a complain filed in July by senior bureaucrat Ashish Joshi, former member-secretary of the Delhi Dialogue Commission (DDC), with the ACB against Kejriwals secretary Rajender Kumar, accusing him of allegedly indulging in corruption.

In the first trading window ahead of the ninth season, the franchises decided to keep money in the bank going into the auction. Having finished second last in the eighth season, Delhi Daredevils were expected to make big changes again, and they have released 10 players in all and will go into the auction with a purse of Rs 36.85 crore, the highest among the eight teams. While releasing Angelo Mathews was expected as he won't be available for the full season due to international commitments, the exclusion of Yuvraj -bought for a whopping Rs16 crore last season - was a marketing decision. A senior Daredevils official told Mail Today that it wasn't smart wasting so much on Yuvraj when he could be available for a lower price in the auction. \"Our CEO Hemant Dua has spoken to all the players - retained and released - and there is no hard feelings with anybody. So, if Yuvraj does well in the limited overs series in Australia, we can always buy him back in the auction. It doesn't really make much sense to keep him for Rs 16 crore and go into the auction with a limited purse. \"If you look around, all seasoned teams have retained 14 or 15 players. Only Mumbai Indians have 19. One needs to be smart and we have a core of players who are young and can serve us better in the future. This was a marketing strategy and IPL isn't only about cricket. We also need to look at the business side of things where we want to maximise your gains both on and off the field,\" he revealed. When contacted, Dua confirmed that he had spoken to Yuvraj and the franchise still holds him in high regard.  Sehwag, too, has been released by Kings XI Punjab as he didn't have a good season last year. With the team finishing at the bottom last year, they too will want to go back to the drawing board and plan better this year.

Theres no attempt to reach out from his part,\" Kejriwal said.  Two DANICS officers - Yashpal Garg, special secretary (Prosecution), and Subhash Chandra, special secretary (Prisons) - had been suspended on Tuesday after they refused to sign a file pertaining to the Cabinet decision to increase salary of public prosecutors.  \"Officers would decide the merit of Cabinet decision? Elected government will have the final say. Cabinet and assembly are supreme. They can ask for a review but cannot strike down a decision,\" Kejriwal also said.  Home Ministry yesterday declared the punitive action against the DANICS officials as null and void. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia also questioned the timing of the protest by the bureaucrats, calling it part of a conspiracy to ensure failure of the odd-even scheme being rolled out tomorrow.  DANICS officers are selected through civil service exams conducted by Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) and the Union Home Ministry is their cadre-controlling authority.  Yesterday, Kejriwal had said \"Professional and Dynamic youth can better develop Delhi. They should be given chance to work on posts which require professional expertise.  \"We are committed to the people of Delhi and would make sure nothing stops even if these officers go on six months leave,\" he had said.  Reacting to the protest, Delhi Home Minister Satyendra Jain had also said DANICS and IAS officers do not have the right to go on strike as it is against their service rule.  The Delhi Home Minister had further said the city government was ready to grant all officers even one month or 15-day leave if they applied.  \"The two officers were suspended for not implementing Cabinet decision on December 28. If they had any problem with my order, they should have approached Chief Minister not LG. Lt Governor has already asked officers to defy government decision,\" he had alleged.  Jain also alleged that BJP is provoking Delhi Government officers to go on strike.  The DANICS Officers Association comprises around 200 members who hold crucial posts including those of Sub-/divisional Magistrates, Secretaries to Ministers and Special Secretaries.

The plea was rejected by Principal Judge P B Desai, presiding over the Special NIA Court here, after the accused - Haji Patel, Mohammad Yunus Shaikh and Abid Patel - declined to give consent to undergo polygraph test.  During arguments today, their lawyer citied various orders of the Supreme Court as well as High Court in this regard and argued that consent of the accused is necessary to conduct lie detection test.  NIA produced a total of six accused in the Court after the expiry of their remand. Besides the trio, the others are Mohsin Khan, Mohammad Altaf and Nisar Ahmed.  As the Central agency did not seek further remand, the court sent all the accused in 14-day judicial custody.  The two BJP leaders - Shirish Bangali and Pragnesh Mistry - were shot dead by two unidentified gunmen in Bharuch, about 200km from here, on November 2.  Bangali was a former President of Bharuch district unit of BJP, while Mistry served as General Secretary of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha.  Initial probe by Gujarat Police revealed the contract for killing the BJP leaders was given allegedly by fugitive underworld don Javed Chikna, apparently to avenge communal riots in Mumbai and Gujarat in 1993 and 2002, respectively.  Based on a request of Gujarat Government, Union Home Ministry handed over the probe in the murders to NIA, which handles terror cases, last month.

Police produced Chintan in Borivali Metropolitan Court, where they moved an application seeking permission to subject him to narco-analysis test as part of their probe into the sensational double murder case that came to light on December 12 when their bodies were found in a drain in Kandivali.  The 44-year-old artist, arrested on December 22, was produced in the Court of Magistrate Prasad Kulkarni after the end of his police custody.  The Investigating Officer told the court that police have recovered a personal dairy, pen drive, hard drives, memory card, IPad and sketches from Chintans house in Delhi.  The materials will be examined to ascertain if they have any link with the murders, he said.  Maintaining that the investigation in the case was complicated, police sought further remand of Chintan.  The officer informed said they want to interrogate Chintan further to find clues about Vidyadhar Rajbhar, a key accused in the case who is still on run.  They need to determine whether matrimonial cases involving Chintan and his estranged wife Hema (43) and dispute over their flat in upscale Juhu area were the motives behind the murders.  They are also questioning Chintan about a Bengaluru- based person, who had supplied sedative that was used for knocking out the victims, the officer said.  After the end of arguments, the Magistrate extended Chintans remand till January 4.  Meanwhile, the Court rejected Chintans plea to undergo health re-examination given his back problem.  Claiming that the artist has severe back problem, his lawyer Nitin Pradhan sought re-examination of his health condition and proper medical assistance for him.  There should be some place for human dignity. Considering that he has severe back problem, Chintan should be provided medical aid, he argued.  However, citing a medical report submitted by JJ Hospital, which claims Chintans health condition is normal, the court rejected the plea.   Pradhan said the Crime Branch, which interrogated Chintan for 10 days, should submit a case diary in the court.  Chintan is accused of conspiring to kill his wife and her lawyer with the help of other accused. The other accused - Pradip Rajbhar, Vijay Rajbhar, Shivkumar Rajbhar and Azaad Rajbhar - are in judicial custody till January 11.

The 15-nation Council, in a presidential statement, issued here yesterdaysaid that it recognises that sustained consultations with the Secretariat and troop and police contributing countries are essential for a \"shared understanding of appropriate responses and their implications for the mandate and conduct of an operation\".  The powerful UN body, however, admitted that current consultations among the Security Council, troop and police-contributing countries and the Secretariat \"do not meet their expectations and have yet to reach their full potential\".  \"The Security Council recognises that the experience and expertise of troop and police contributing countries in theatres of operation can greatly assist the planning of operations.  The Security Council stresses the importance of substantive, representative and meaningful exchanges and underscores the importance of full participation by the three stakeholders so that meetings are useful and productive,\" the UNSC said in the statement.  India has repeatedly criticised the Security Council over the lack of accountability and transparencyin the framing of peacekeeping mandates and has said that this \"failing\" by the world body is resultingin rising casualties among peacekeepers and civilians.  Indias PermanentRepresentative to the UN Asoke Mukerji, who retired last month, has said at various UN fora that the SecurityCouncil must consult troop contributing countries before drawingup peacekeeping mandates given that troops now have tofunction is increasingly difficult and hostile conflictsituations across the worlds hot-spots.  Mukerji had said that Article 44 of the UN Charter clearly calls on the Security Council to invite Member States not represented in the Council to participate in the decisions of the Security Council concerning the employment of contingents of that Members armed forces but lamented that \"this hardly ever happens in actual practice\".  He had stressed that troop and police contributing countries can play a role in assisting the Council to determine the kind and number of troops required for the proposed mandate, the nature of equipment required, and the costs of operating in the specific terrain of the theatre of operations.  India is the largest cumulative troop contributor to UNpeace operations, with over 185,000 troops having served in 48of the 69 missions mandated so far.  Issuing the presidential statement, the Council noted, in particular, the view of the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations and the Secretary-General that the lack of effective dialogue among those stakeholders had generated frustration on all sides and undermined mandate implementation.  Further, the Council recognised that those consultations failed to reach their full potential despite the existence of many mechanisms, such as the Working Group, formal and informal dialogues, the General Assembly?s Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, and the Military Staff Committee.

The Sports Ministry does not normally give grants to the IOA but it bears the expenditure incurred on items like air passage, accommodation, ceremonial kit and playing kit for participation of Indian contingent in Olympics, Asian Games and Commonwealth Games. In a statement issued on December 22, the ministry said that it had released Rs 2,28,48,524 as grants to the IOA in 2012-13 and Rs 16,93,44,359 in 2014-15 for expenditure incurred on these items. The IOAs grouse is that the ministry has taken advantage of this practice to the extent that it has asserted before the courts that the government can enforce the Sports Code on the national sports apex body on the ground that it receives grants from it. The IOA, which has been at loggerheads for some time with the government on the implementation of the Sports Code, said that it was mulling asking the Ministry to disburse the expenses to be incurred by the athletes taking part in multi-sporting events directly to them individually and not through it. \"Its a misleading practice. Whatever grants the ministry used to show in the government circulars are only meant for the expenses incurred by the athletes for taking part in multi-sporting events.

Emanuel Lutchman was arrested and charged by criminal complaint with attempting to provide material support to ISIS and faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a USD 250,000 fine.  \"According to the complaint, as part of Emanuel Lutchmans attempt to provide material support to ISIS, he planned to kill innocent civilians on New Year?s Eve in the name of the terrorist organisation,\" Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin said in announcing the charges.  The complaint said Lutchman is a \"self-professed Muslim convert\" with a criminal history dating back to 2006.  According to court records, he had claimed to receive direction from an overseas ISIS member and planned to commit an armed attack against civilians at a restaurant/bar located in the Rochester area on New Year?s Eve on behalf of ISIS and in furtherance of his plan to join ISIS overseas.  The defendant made an initial appearance this morning before US Magistrate Judge Marian Payson of the US Western District of New York.  Prosecutors said Lutchman communicated with an individual who had been cooperating with the FBI and had expressed his strong support for ISIS and his desire to travel overseas and join ISIS in Syria.  Lutchman told the individual that he was in contact with an ISIS supporter overseas who told him that since New Year?s eve is approaching, he should do some \"operations and kill\" people to show his seriousness towards ISIS.  He also discussed doing assassinations and using a pressure cooker bomb and in one of the meetings with the cooperating individual, Lutchman said he wanted to target a club or bar where they \"sneak\" a bomb, \"kidnap a couple of people and kill them\".

But the Delhi High Court gave BAI clearance in November and withheld the injunction that Sporty Solutionz had requested. This was the second such petition that has been filed by Sporty Solutionz after the BAI terminated the IBL contract on April 21. The first petition, a copy of which is in possession of  IANS,  was dismissed by the high court on May 29. Finally in December, the Supreme Court allowed the BAI to hold the PBL from January 2 to 17. Bollywood actress Jacqueline Fernandez and music composer duo Salim-Sulaiman will perform at the opening ceremony. Jacqueline will be seen dancing to the tunes of her famous dance numbers. This will be followed by Salim and Sulaiman performing the PBL anthem. Some more captivating performances will also follow. The first match will see a clash between Awadhe Warriors, spearheaded by 2012 Olympic bronze medallist and 2015 World Championship silver medallist  Saina Nehwal , and Mumbai Rockets.

If it was Johnnie Walker or Absolut, chances are you had cheap liquor packaged as expensive drink. With the party season on in full swing, branded bottles of alcohol are flying off the shelves. Unfortunately for the Capital's party animals, authorities have found fake bottles of popular foreign brands during raids across the city. The excise department of the Delhi government has complained about fake barcodes on bottles of big foreign liquor brands. At least four criminal cases of cheating have been registered at different police stations in Delhi and investigations have been initiated after raids in which foreign liquor bottles with forged barcodes were recovered. \"Fake barcode means the liquor has been procured through some illegal source. It may be spurious. Or, it may be a cheaper brand. To make money illegally, repackaging of liquor bottles is also done by criminal elements,\" said a senior official of the excise department. To check the inflow of fake liquor in the city, Delhi excise department had started a barcode system on liquor bottles in 2013. Legal bottles of liquor have a unique identification number that can be read only with a 2D barcode reader. However, officials of Excise Intelligence Bureau (EIB) were surprised when they checked barcodes of bottles recovered during different raids recently. A raid was conducted at a banquet hall in west Delhi on December 20 where officials found glaring indiscrepancies. \"All the permits were in place, but discrepancies were found when officials checked the barcodes of different bottles,\" said an official. \u00c2 \u00c2  Bottles of brands like Jonnie Walker and others having forged bar codes have been seized Fake barcode means that the liquor is procured through illegal source It may be spurious. Or, it may be of cheaper brand To make more money illegally, repackaging of liquor bottle is also done by some criminal elements Bar code is forged also to evade heavy excise duty which leads to loss To check the inflow of fake liquor in the city, Delhi excise department had started barcode system on the liquor bottles Legal bottles of liquor have a unique identification number that can be read via a 2D barcode reader  Two bottles of Absolut Vodka showed the same barcodes (08901522-0330381409180344). When scanned through the system, they were found to be invalid. Similarly, five bottles of Black Label blended scotch whisky (Johnnie Walker) showed the same barcode (089060-533507081308119935) and were also found to be invalid. Further investigations revealed the bottles with the original barcodes (0890152203303-81409180344 and 0890605-33507081308119935) were sold many months back, whereas, these bottles of liquor with fake barcodes were purchased only on December 12, last year, from a city-based vend. \"The barcodes were verified and were found to be forged. Forged barcode stickers have been used to evade excise duty and there is possibility of spurious liquor being supplied,\" said the FIR registered on December 23. In another instance, a raid was conducted at Vasant Kunj and officials recovered bottles of Black Label and Absolut Vodka and a case of cheating was registered on December 7. After yet another raid in September, at a party alongside NH 1, forged bar codes on bottles of Red Label were confiscated. Before this, a raid was conducted at a mall in Rajouri Garden area where officials recovered bottles of Chivas Regal and Sula Red Wine with forged barcodes. Excise department officials said the demand for foreign liquor has gone up this year and it has registered a growth of over 60 per cent as compared to last year. Excise department is one of the main sources of revenue for the Delhi government. The estimated target for this year is about Rs 4,000 crore and officials said that the department has already got about Rs 2,800 crore. Officials said that the 2D barcode system was introduced as part of the department's Excise Supply Chain Information Management System (ESCIMS) and it was made mandatory on all bottles. Distilleries are provided a barcode sequence number before scheduling a lot. The liquor bottles are scanned at government warehouses, from where they are sent to retail outlets. The government has also introduced a mobile app to verify the authenticity of liquor brands and to check sales of illicit liquor. The app, mLiquor-SaleCheck, allows customers to verify the authenticity of the liquor purchased and at the same time helps the excise department monitor sale of illicit and spurious liquor in the city. The app provides real-time information based on the barcode scan. The scan provides information such as brand name, size, etc, from a central server and the app also tells the customer whether the liquor has been bought through an excise-approved system or not.

Todays announcement came within days of I&B Minister  Arun Jaitley  telling PTI that the \"time has come\" to have a re-look at the functioning of censor board as he would like the certification board to be \"controversy-free\".  Filmmakers have complained of arbitrary objections and cuts sought by the board in the recent past including the criticism for the cuts the latest James Bond movie \"Spectre\" had to go through for its screening in India.  A list of banned \"cuss\" words, circulated by CBFC chief Pahlaj Nihalani had also become a subject of controversy.  When contacted, Benegal told PTI that the I&B ministry \"spoke to me a couple of days ago...I am yet to know exactly what the proposal is...This is a committee formed by the government to see how effective, transparent and satisfactory the system is.\"  Welcoming governments decision, Nihalani said, \"There are good people in the committee and I am confident that they will bring new reforms.\" PTI ADS NDS PYK ZMN", "section": "Entertainment", "topics": {"MINISTRY AND DEPARTMENTS, MINISTERS": 0.02702702702702703, "GOVERNMENT, GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS": 0.08108108108108109, "TRENDING ISSUES": 0.02702702702702703, "ENTERTAINMENT": 0.21621621621621623}, "day": 1}

The year also witnessed two new secretaries -- Sekhar Basu of Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and A S Kirankumar Department of Space (DoS) -- taking charge.  ISROs satellites included two communication ones -- GSAT 6 and GSAT 7 -- and IRNSS-1D, the fourth of the seven satellites constituting the space segment of the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System.  IRNSS-1A, 1B and 1C, the first three satellites of the constellation, were successfully launched earlier. India also launched ASTROSAT satellite, its first space research observatory, something which only the US, Russia, the EU and Japan has.  But more striking was ISROs achievement of launching foreign satellites. This year, Indias space arm launched six Singaporean satellites, four from the US, five from the UK and one from Canada and Indonesia each. This also heralded a new era for ISRO as India faced an embargo from the US post nuclear test in 1973 and 1997, which hampered its space programme.  For its work, including the success of Mars Orbiter Mission, Indias first inter-planetary mission, ISRO was awarded the Gandhi Peace Prize and Space Pioneer Award by US- based National Space Society.  However, ISRO also had its share of controversies. In September, an international tribunal asked Antrix, ISROs commercial arm, to pay USD 672 million to Devas in the controversial Antrix-Devas case.  There were complaints about the manner in which the deal was entered into and the way in which it was being operationalised. In 2011, the Centre had annulled the controversial deal between the Antrix Corporation and Bangalore-based Devas Multimedia.  On the other hand, the nuclear sector saw resolution to major impending issues.  Ahead of President Barack Obamas visit to India as Republic Day chief guest of 2015, India addressed the concerns raised by domestic as well as foreign players on the clauses of Civil Liability Nuclear Damages Act 2010. Following this, a Nuclear Insurance Pool was formed and operationalised.  The passage of the amendment to the Atomic Energy Act 1962 in the Winter Session of Parliament for enabling NPCIL to enter into joint ventures with other PSUs, will help expand nuclear energy production in India.

For the first time, every country in the world has pledged to curb their emissions, strengthen resilience and act internationally and domestically to address climate change. By addressing climate change we are advancing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,\" Ban had said.  The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development calls on countries to begin efforts to achieve the 17 SDGs over the next 15 years.  The goals address the needs of people in both developed and developing countries, emphasising that no one should be left behind. Broad and ambitious in scope, the agenda addresses the three dimensions of sustainable development -- social, economic and environmental, as well as important aspects related to peace, justice and effective institutions.  The mobilisation of means of implementation, including financial resources, technology development and transfer and capacity-building, as well as the role of partnerships, are also acknowledged as critical.  The 17 SDGs build on the eight MDGs, which specifically sought by 2015 -- to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger; achieve universal primary education; promote gender equality and empower women; reduce child mortality; improve maternal health; combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases; ensure environmental sustainability; and develop a global partnership for development.  While the MDGs have accomplished a lot, progress has been uneven across regions and countries, leaving millions of people behind, especially the poorest and those disadvantaged due to sex, age, disability, ethnicity or geographic location.  The SDGs are expected to plug the holes left by the MDGs and accomplish more.  They stress everything from zero poverty, zero hunger, good health, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, and affordable clean energy, to decent work and economic growth, innovation, reducing inequalities, sustainable cities, responsible consumption, climate action, unpolluted oceans and land and partnerships to achieve the goals.

In two separate orders, the Securities and Exchange and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has levied a fine of Rs 1.5 lakh each on the companies.  The regulator in April 2013 had directed all listed companies to obtain Sebi Complaints Redressal System (SCORES) authentication within the stipulated time. However, these firms failed to comply with the order.  Thereafter, a letter dated December 2, 2013, was issued to these companies, whereby these firms were once again advised to submit the requisite information regarding SCORES authentication by December 18, 2013. However, these companies again failed to comply with the direction.  Chitrakoot Properties and Amrapali Films got registered with SCORES on March 23 and May 25 of this year, respectively.  Arihant had submitted a document to Sebi showing that it had applied for SCORES authentication on June 10, last year.  \"Failure to comply with the directions of Sebi contained in the Sebi circular and thereafter the directions contained in the letter dated December 2, 2013 amounts to repeated violation of the directions given by Sebi,\" the regulator said in similar-worded orders.  Launched by Sebi in June 2011, SCORES provides a centralised database of all complaints. Online movement of complaints to the listed companies concerned and upload of their Action Taken Reports (ATRs) are done through this system.  It also helps investors view, track and follow up the action taken on their grievances. The online redressal system has significantly helped in reducing the processing time of complaints.

A smiling Adnan, 46, received the citizenship certificate from Minister of State for Home  Kiren Rijiju  at North Block here in the presence of his wife Roya after which he sang his famous song--\"Teri oonchi shaan hai maula...Mujhko bhi to lift kara de\".  \"A New Beginning... A New Feeling... A New Belonging... A New Love Affair... A New Country... JAI HIND!!!,\" said Adnan, who has made India as his second home for the past few years, in a series of tweets shortly after getting the certificate.  \"My Profound thanks to Honourable Prime Minister @narendramodi ji for approving my Indian Citizenship. A New birth!  \"Im highly indebted to the Honourable HM @BJPRajnathSingh ji for his tremendous support in granting me Indian Citizenship,\" he said.  Asked about concerns expressed by actors  Aamir Khan  and  Shah Rukh Khan  over the climate of intolerance in India, he said everyone was entitled to his or her own opinion and their remarks were perhaps based on their own experience.  \"Had there been intolerance, I would not have taken Indian citizenship. I have never experienced intolerance. There is no intolerance in India,\" he said.  The singer said he was very happy after becoming Indian citizen and grateful to the government.  \"I am grateful to the government of India for giving me this beautiful gift,\" he said. BJP ally Shiv Sena expressed surprise at Sami being granted Indian citizenship, saying it showed the senior NDA partners \"double standards\" on the issue.  \"When BJP was in opposition, it protested against Adnan Sami, now they are granting him citizenship,\" Sena spokesperson Manisha Kayande said.  Asked if Sena will hold protests over this issue, Kayande told PTI, \"I am just saying we are surprised at the turn of events. BJP vehemently opposed Sami while in opposition. But once in power, he gets citizenship\". \"In pursuance of the powers conferred by the Citizenship Act, upon taking the oath of allegiance within the time and in the manner required by the rules made in that behalf, he shall, subject to the provisions of the said Act, be entitled to all political and other rights, powers and privileges, and be subject to all obligations, duties and liabilities to which an Indian citizen is entitled or subject, and have right to all intents and purposes and the status of an Indian citizen,\" a Home Ministry statement said. Home Ministry officials said Sami has been given Indian citizenship following his request to the Centre to legalise his status in the country on humanitarian grounds.  The singer had made a representation to the Home Ministry on May 26 this year requesting that he be allowed to stay in India on humanitarian grounds.  Sami had first arrived in India on March 13, 2001 on a visitors visa with the validity of one year which was issued by the Indian High Commission in Islamabad.  His visa was extended from time to time. His Pakistani passport issued on May 27, 2010 expired on May 26, 2015 and his passport was not renewed by the Pakistan government which led him to approach the Indian government with the request to legalise his stay in India.  Samis two songs from the album, Kabhi To Nazar Milao and Lift Kara De, whose music video starred actor Govinda, were a sensation in the early 2000s.  Last year the singer tasted success with his song Bhar Do Jholi meri in  Salman Khan -starrer Bajrangi Bhaijaan.

In recent times, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has come across complaints and cases pertaining to app-based services, e-commerce and use of interface having intellectual property, among others. Noting that the technological landscape is changing fast, the CCI chairman said areas such as e-commerce and app-based services will become more prominent. \"So, it will move speedily from brick-and-mortar kind of competition assessment to an assessment that goes into the areas of, necessarily difficult, new technologies. That will be a challenge the Commission will have to gear up to,\" Chawla told PTI in an interview. Under Chawla, who has been at the helm since October 2011 and is retiring this month, the regulator has dealt with a significant number of cases spread across diverse sectors, including realty, infrastructure, technology and aviation. With respect to the mergers and acquisitions, the Commission has so far cleared more than 360 proposals while only three deals have been subject to public scrutiny. In two of the deals -- Sun Pharma-Ranbaxy and Holcim-Lafarge -- where detailed scrutiny was undertaken, the Commission asked the entities to divest certain assets in order to address competition concerns. The latest one put up for public scrutiny is PVR Cinemas proposed acquisition of DT Cinemas in a Rs 500-crore transaction. \"I think it (M&As) will slowly start moving beyond the innocuous consolidation and beyond the intra-group merger, which have been there quite a bit in the past, to more complex M&As which will necessarily stress the capabilities of the Commission,\" he emphasised. So far, detailed assessments were carried out in just 1-2 per cent of the total M&A cases and Chawla feels that this number will go up to 5-7 per cent or more over the next five years. Further, he said the number of cases received by the Commission on the behavioural side will increase. Presently, the regulator gets about 100 cases every year, but in a majority of cases, it has found that they do not fall under the ambit of the competition regulations. \"Both in terms of numbers and the types of complaints, I think there will be (an increase)... I see many more complaints coming in. So, I think the tendency among businesses of not complaining against each other and stopping shy of that will probably change,\" Chawla noted. He also said the Commission will be happier to see cases which are clearly in the ambit of competition law coming to it, rather than those in the nature of contractual or consumer disputes.

Immigration officials said that for all Pakistani nationals, the port of entry is Delhi or Mumbai. No Pakistani can enter the country from Hyderabad. Shiv Sena has made it clear, on a number of occasions, that it is against any relationship with Pakistan till the neighbouring nation dismantles terror factories operating on its soil. Sena, a junior partner of the BJP both in Maharashtra as well as the Centre, has been protesting against the participation of Pakistani citizens in Indian events. In October last year, Shiv Sena's protest forced organisers to cancel Pakistani singer Ghulam Ali's concert in Mumbai and Pune. Its workers had also blackened the face of columnist and former BJP ideologue Sudheendra Kulkarni for organising the launch of a book by former Pakistan minister Khurshid Mahmood Kasuri, leading to a massive national outrage.

Workers from western Maharashtra districts of Pune, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Satara, Sangli, Solapur and Kolhapur have registered themselves for the gathering to be addressed by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat.  Coordinator of the event Sarang Wable said it would be the biggest conclave of the RSS workers in the recent past.  He said the main purpose of the gathering was to reach out to civil societies and social service organisations in the country.  \"The purpose of the meet is to project Sangh as a positive force in the society, and to further open up to the wider audience. The main thing we want to highlight is the ideals of discipline practised among the followers of Sangh. We felt there is a need to showcase the core aspects of the Sangh to important people in the society,\" Wable said.

Does it feel like everyone is out there to get you? Do small arguments involving you, often turn into huge fights?  Well, then you have to hear what we have to say. According to a report in IANS, a bunch of mental experts say that giving up on anger, will help you attain a healthy lifestyle.  But what exactly is anger?  According to Dr. Samir Parikh, director, mental health and behavioural sciences, Fortis Healthcare Limited, anger can be defined as \"..a natural response by our body, which triggers the 'fight or flight' response in perception of potential threat, attack, injustice or disappointment.\" Even though anger is an emotion which is experienced by every person at some point of time, it has been noted that more and more people, including children, lose their cool very easily nowadays. Which according to Dr. Sanju Ghambir, senior consultant psychotherapy and counselling, Primus Super Specialty Hospital can be blamed on the fast-paced life today. She adds \"We are getting a lot of patients now. They have a lot of anger in them because they don't have patience. We are living in a time where everything is instant. All we have to do is go online. When we don't get results fast, that's when people start getting angry.Children as young as three show anger. Be it sibling rivalry or not getting toy of their choice, anything can be the reason. Sometimes, even watching cartoons leads to anger because there is a lot of violence in that.\"  Ghambir also threw light on the the fact that earlier, there were more cases of men losing temper, but now, with the demand for equality, women are no longer hiding their emotions. \"Now even women are expressing anger. More women are becoming aware of their own role. With that in mind, women also feel why they should keep quiet. So that role of keeping quiet to control the situation is going out now because a woman has her own ego to satisfy,\" she said. It has also been noted, that age has almost nothing to do with anger. There hasn't been any significant proof of the fact that as a person grows older, he/she turns calmer.  Throwing light on the physical and psychological manifestations of anger, Parikh says that the common signs of anger include sweating, headaches and restlessness. It reportedly, also arouses the nervous system, leading to an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and other regulatory functions of the body. \"Frequent anger is likely to lead to adverse impacts on the person's physical health, increasing the risk for illnesses like hypertension or cardiovascular diseases, sleep disturbance, skin problem, in addition to interference in occupational, social, and interpersonal functioning,\" Parikh adds.  The long-term effects of anger not only include difficulty in decision making, increased anxiety and depression but also, stomach ulcers.  According to Atul Verma, senior psychologist from SCI International Hospital, \"Expression is the act of conveying your anger. Expression ranges from a reasonable, rational discussion to a violent outburst. Suppression is an attempt to hold in your anger and possibly convert it into more constructive behaviour.\" He also says that techniques like, counting numbers backward and taking a deep breaths, when angry, can bring down your outburst in considerable amounts.  Adding to which, Parikh says \"When a person is angry, the individual experiences a surge of energy, which typically is externalised in the form of shouting, or aggression. Instead, the person should be encouraged to have regular physical activity, be it in the form of a sport, workout, dance or even walking or jogging.\"  With inputs from IANS", "section": "Issues", "topics": {"POLICE": 0.05263157894736842, "HEALTH AND LIVING": 0.3684210526315789, "TRENDING ISSUES": 0.3684210526315789}, "day": 1}

The 57-year-old Chairman of Sadbhawana Party, one of the four Madhes-based political parties that have launched an agitation in southern Nepal under the banner of United Democratic Madhesi Front, has left for New Delhi for medical treatment, according to Vice president of the party Laxaman Lal Karna.  The senior Madhesi leader was initially airlifted from Dharan, where he was undergoing treatment for the past week, to the capital Kathmandu, from where he was again airlifted to Delhi.  The leader, who had sustained injuries including on head during a clash between the largely Indian-origin Madhesis and police at Biratnagar-Jogabani border check-point on December 26, was flown to Delhi as his health condition could not improve much even after staying in the ICU for some time, Karna told PTI.  He was injured during baton charging by the police as he was leading a group of Madhesi cadres for a sit-in to blockade movement of vehicles in the border area.  The police had baton charged the agitators and fired teargas shells to disperse them.  The senior Madhesi leader had spent over a week while undergoing treatment at a local hospital in Biratnagar and Dharan-based B P Koirala Institute of Health Sciences.  Mahatos blood pressure and sugar level were also found to be higher than normal.  He had fallen unconscious for some time while undergoing treatment, sources close to him said.  Mahato, along with three other senior Madhesi leaders, had travelled to Delhi for political consultation last month and held talks with senior Indian leaders including External Affairs Minister  Sushma Swaraj .  Madhesis have resorted to aggressive protests after Mahato sustained injuries and have demanded action against the security personnel involved in the incident.  Madhesis are agitating over the new Constitution demanding more representation. They are also protesting division of their ancestral homeland under the seven-province structure and have led an ongoing blockade of key border trade points with India.

Of course, this surprise visit by him left the audience in shock and awe. The Hateful Eight director had a Q&A session with the audience present in the theatre at Alamo Drafthouse.  Tarantino was accompanied by Tim League, CEO of the theatre, who announced to the crowd, \"You guys are the lucky ones!\".  During Q&A session Tarantino confessed that he wrote The Hateful Eight script while he was depressed and angry.  Tarantino further admitted that he started writing the script of The Hateful Eight as a sequel to 2012's Django Unchained which he initially titled Django in White Hell. But soon he realized that the character of Django as a folk lore among the natives won't fit the subject of his current film. \"All of a sudden, it hit me the only thing wrong [with the story] was Django.

System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) had yesterday said that air quality in Delhi was expected to deteriorate over the next few days with a possible rise in the level of particulate matter due to fall in minimum temperature and calm wind movement.  Officials said the air quality remained \"very poor\" today due to atmospheric conditions that did not allow pollutants to get dispersed.  While a section of the ruling AAP attributed the sharp drop in PM 2.5 figures between early morning hours and afternoon to the car rationing experiment, scientists said pollutants usually touch their peak in the dawn and then gradually fall.  SAFAR stations, located in various areas the city, displayed very poor real-time Air Quality Index, which was in line with the forecast of the Union government body that was released yesterday.  In no marked change from yesterday, the average levels of PM 2.5 was around 180 microgrammes per cubic metre, three times above the safe limit of 60. The corresponding safe limit of PM 10 is 100.  Central Pollution Control Boards real time AQI for the Punjabi Bagh, R K Puram, NSIT Dwarka and Anand Vihar stations were severe at 5 PM.  \"The boundary layer, beyond which pollutants cannot escape, comes near the earths surface during the early morning hours resulting in the accumulation of pollutants. So the spike that was observed around 5.30 AM and the subsequent fall is understandable,\" Project Director, SAFAR, Gufran Beig said.  Scientists also said that a straightforward comparison of todays pollution figures with last years data would be \"misleading\" as weather was colder which had resulted in more pollution.  Tomorrow onwards, a sharp spike in the volume of PM 2.5 is expected due to possible fall in minimum temperature and calm wind movement, with it rising to 192 first and 201 by January 3. The corresponding figures for PM 10 are expected to be around 334 and 349.  Air quality is considered very poor by Indian authorities when level of PM 2.5 ranges from 120 to 250 microgrammes per cubic metre.

An earlier plea by Bhangoo, one of the main promoters of the PACL group which includes companies like Pearls Agrotech Corp Ltd and Pearls Golden Forest Ltd (PGFL), is already pending before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT). Facing heat from multiple agencies in the countrys biggest illegal fund-mobilisation case, Bhangoo had moved SAT on December 30 against Sebis recovery proceedings to collect funds due to investors. A single-member bench had listed the matter for today, as the Presiding Officer of the Tribunal was on vacation. In todays proceedings, the Tribunal refused to grant any immediate stay sought by Bhangoo and listed the matter for hearing on January 29. Earlier this week, PACL had also filed a writ petition before the Delhi High Court seeking a stay on Sebis recovery proceedings which the regulator initiated earlier last month against PACL, Bhangoo and others to recover funds totalling more than Rs 60,000 crore that they were asked to refund to investors. While PACL is being probed by multiple agencies including CBI and ED, Sebi found it to have collected money from crores of investors through unauthorised collective investment schemes in the name of real estate projects. It is also said to have been involved in agriculture land related schemes. The mobilisation of funds date back to 1990s. However, the court has not granted any stay and the matter is likely to be heard further next month. Interestingly, SAT has previously rejected a plea by PACL against Sebis earlier refund order asking the company and its promoters and directors to refund Rs 49,100 crore along with applicable returns and interest to the investors. The company had also approached Supreme Court, which has not granted any stay on the matter. After hearing another plea earlier in 2013, the apex court had directed Sebi to probe the matter involving PACLs fund-collection schemes and take appropriate actions. Last month, the government had said that instructions have also been issued to Registrar of Companies to file prosecutions against PACL for non-compliance of provisions of the Companies Act and accounting standards.  Replying to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Finance  Jayant Sinha  had said that the government had received various complaints with regard to collection of deposits by PACL India alleging non-payment of amounts advanced to the company for purchase of land, money laundering and non-settlement of accounts in respect to transfer of land.

These were 12,012 units or 10 per cent more than the comparable numbers in 2014,\" the German company said in a statement.  It said the record production was driven by higher demand in domestic as well as export markets, led by its Vento model, which cornered around 60 per cent of the total production.  With this, production at Chakan, Pune plant crossed 5,75,000 unit since the start of operations in March 2009.  Volkswagen India president and MD managing director Andreas Lauermann said the Pune plant increased production for the third year in a row following rising demand from both domestic as well as export markets.  He expressed hope that the new sedan in the pipeline will help in carrying the pace forward in 2016, even though the second half of the year gone by was challenging due to the emission cheating crisis.  He said out of the 1,23,456 units rolled out from the Chakan plant, around 72,000 were Vento sedans, 38,800 Polo compacts and 12,700 of Skoda Rapids.  Production for domestic sales grew 23 per cent to 54,140 units, and for exports rose 4 per cent to 69,300 units in 2015.  It ships Ventos to over 35 markets, with Argentina being the latest. The Pune-made Vento was showcased at the Hannover Messe in April 2015.  The Volkswagen Group, present in the country for the past 14 years, sells five passenger car brands in India -- Audi, Lamborghini, Porsche, Skoda and Volkswagen.  While the group entered the country in 2001 with Skoda, the Audi and Volkswagen brands came in 2007, with Porsche and Lamborghini brands following in 2012. Each brand operates as an independent entity here.  The Volkswagen Group India sells over 25 models through its 240 dealerships and most of the cars are assembled at its Pune and Aurangabad plants.  The Pune plant has an annual capacity of 1,30,000 units and rolls out the Polo and Vento from the Volkswagen stable and the Rapid from Skoda, while the Aurangabad plant with a capacity of 89,000 units assembles various premium and luxury models from the Audi, Skoda and Volkswagen stables.

Expressing reservations over the Odd-Even scheme, Upadhayay said there were \"practical problems\" in the scheme which could have been discussed and ironed out before its implementation.  Citing his own experience, Upadhyay said, \"I have both odd and even numbered vehicles but when I received a call about an injured party worker, I could not move immediately as only even (rpt even) numbered vehicle was available while the odd (rpt odd) numbered one was being used by my son. Finally I called a friend but I was delayed half an hour in taking the worker to trauma centre.\"  \"Also, there are problems like women not allowed to drive along with say their male family members even if they do not know driving. Many drivers who were driving even numbered cars paid fine just because they had no availability of public transport to their workplaces,\" he said.  \"All these problems pointed that the scheme was launched in a hurry without working on its micro-detailing and coming out with solutions to the practical problems,\" he said.

Harry left the army half-way through the year and spent six weeks in the summer working on a series of conservation projects in Africa.

ODonovan, who compiles the figures every year based on engagements announced in the Court Circular, said the number carried out by the Queen was remarkable.  \"Except for Christmas Day and Easter Day, the Queen never has a day off from the official red boxes which pursue her everywhere,\" he told the newspaper.

Asked about the incident, Khan told PTI, \"The authorities and I were right in our own ways and the airline in question was wrong as they should have known that as a Pakistani national which ports in India we are authorised to travel. Hence, it was their fault and I as an individual had to make this journey in 29 hours.\"  A senior official of an airlines said Pakistani nationals can enter India only through Delhi and Mumbai airports.  \"Khan had to go back to Abu Dhabi and flew back to Delhi. From there he came to Hyderabad and performed at the event,\" Ena Sharma, an official associated with the event, said.  Meanwhile, a senior police official said the movements of all Pakistani nationals entering into the country are recorded at the entry points of New Delhi and Mumbai.  Since Hyderabad does not figure into the authorised entry points, Pakistani nationals are not allowed to enter the country through this airport, he added.  The immigration official said that Khan was deported back to UAE by the same UAE-based airlines.

For India internationals like comeback men Yuvraj and Nehra, along with fringe players, it will be a testing ground where they can stake claim for a berth in the team for ICC World T20 in March. For those plying their trade in domestic cricket, Mushtaq Ali T20 trophy will give them a platform to impress the various franchises with their skills before the big IPL auction in February. The BCCI, in a positive step, has decided to hold Mushtaq Ali T20 keeping the World T20 in mind. The tournament over years had lost significance for being conducted hastily just before Indian Premier League. With auctions over, the domestic talents did not get an opportunity to land IPL contracts. Punjab skipper Harbhajan and Yuvraj will be fighting it out against Rajasthan at Kochi while Nehra, who made a comeback into the Indian team after four and half years, will be getting himself battle ready with Delhi taking on Railways. After being selected in the Indian T20 team, he would certainly like some match simulation before boarding the flight to Australia. For Yuvraj and Nehra, the additional incentive would be to impress the franchise owners as they are both without any IPL team.

It will be after 19 long years that a Bengal team would be without the talismanic all-rounder Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who announced his retirement from competitive cricket, as they take on Hyderabad in Nagpur. Skipper Manoj Tiwary and senior pacer Ashok Dinda, who got IPL snubs from DD and RCB respectively, will get a chance to keep the franchises interested.

The duo, identified as Prathamesh Pandya and Gunjan Patil, were working as a manager and an employee, respectively, for a company called XDirect, and were arrested on Wednesday, Vadodara city police commissioner E Radhakrishna told PTI today.  They were arrested from the companys office located in Manubhai Tower at Sayajigunj area of Vadodara.  XDirect is registered in Mauritius and its India headquarters is based in Mumbai.  The illegal activity of Dabba trading is also conducted in equities and currencies.  Dabba means box and a dabba operator, in stock market terminology, is the one who indulges in dabba trading. The dabba operators office is like any other brokers office having terminals linked to the stock exchange showing market rates of stocks.  Unlike the main market trade, which now happens online, dabba trading takes place in office, and since it leaves no record, except in the book of the illegal operator, both the buyers and sellers better their margins as they can easily evade any regulatory tax.  As dabba trading is not done on any recognised exchange platform, it is beyond the reach of taxmen or regulators.  Radhakrishna said that a local court has remanded both Pandya and Patil in judicial custody.  He said a team of CID will soon travel to Mumbai, as the companys main office is located there.  The companys Mumbai office, based at suburban Goregaon, could not be contacted as the phone number given is out of order.  The market watchdog, Sebi could not be immediately contacted.  \"Initial information suggests that XDirect, which is registered in Mauritius, has been running the illegal business in the city since February 2014,\" the police commissioner added.  He said this could be the first such instance of illegal trade in foreign currencies being reported from Gujarat.

The plea was rejected by Principal Judge P B Desai, presiding over the Special NIA Court here, after the accused - Haji Patel, Mohammad Yunus Shaikh and Abid Patel - declined to give consent to undergo polygraph test.  During arguments today, their lawyer citied various orders of the Supreme Court as well as High Court in this regard and argued that consent of the accused is necessary to conduct lie detection test.  NIA produced a total of six accused in the Court after the expiry of their remand. Besides the trio, the others are Mohsin Khan, Mohammad Altaf and Nisar Ahmed.  As the Central agency did not seek further remand, the court sent all the accused in 14-day judicial custody.  The two BJP leaders - Shirish Bangali and Pragnesh Mistry - were shot dead by two unidentified gunmen in Bharuch, about 200km from here, on November 2.  Bangali was a former President of Bharuch district unit of BJP, while Mistry served as General Secretary of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha.  Initial probe by Gujarat Police revealed the contract for killing the BJP leaders was given allegedly by fugitive underworld don Javed Chikna, apparently to avenge communal riots in Mumbai and Gujarat in 1993 and 2002, respectively.  Based on a request of Gujarat Government, Union Home Ministry handed over the probe in the murders to NIA, which handles terror cases, last month.

It said the record production was driven by higher demand in domestic as well as export markets, led by its Vento model, which cornered around 60 per cent of the total production.   With this, production at Chakan, Pune plant crossed 5,75,000 unit since the start of operations in March 2009.   Volkswagen India president and MD managing director Andreas Lauermann said the Pune plant increased production for the third year in a row following rising demand from both domestic as well as export markets.   He expressed hope that the new sedan in the pipeline will help in carrying the pace forward in 2016, even though the second half of the year gone by was challenging due to the emission cheating crisis.   He said out of the 1,23,456 units rolled out from the Chakan plant, around 72,000 were Vento sedans, 38,800 Polo compacts and 12,700 of   Skoda  Rapids.   Production for domestic sales grew 23 per cent to 54,140 units, and for exports rose 4 per cent to 69,300 units in 2015.   It ships Ventos to over 35 markets, with Argentina being the latest.

The Volkswagen Group, present in the country for the past 14 years, sells five passenger car brands in India -- Audi, Lamborghini, Porsche, Skoda and Volkswagen.

If so, you can put them to the test by searching the Eastern sky for a view of a fuzzy comet on the first day of 2016.   Comet Catalina, formally known as \"C/2013 US10\", is currently perched in the pre-dawn skies as it returns to the depths of space following a recent visit to the inner part of our solar system,   NASA  said in a statement.   At minimum, binoculars are required to view the comet which will appear as a fuzzy envelope of ice and dust, known as a coma.   Perhaps the simplest way to find   Comet Catalina  is to first locate the \"Big Dipper\" in the pre-dawn sky.   Note how the handle forms a sort of \"arc\".   That \"arc\" can be followed to the orange giant star known as Arcturus which, for those in the Northern Hemisphere, is the second brightest star in the sky and relatively easy to identify.   On New Year's day, the comet will pass a mere 0.5 degrees - about the width of the moon - to the west of Arcturus.   So if you head outdoors 60-90 minutes before dawn, let Arcturus serve as your guide to find the faint, fuzzy patch of Comet Catalina.   \"Of course, for optimal viewing, it's recommended that you observe away from streetlights and city skyglow,\" the statement read.   If you miss Comet Catalina, don't despair. You can still be treated to an alternate planetary extravaganza in the morning sky where   Venus  gleams in the southeast.   Just before dawn on New Year's Day, Saturn will be about eight degrees to the lower left of Venus. By January 4, the pair will appear even closer together.   On January 6 and 7, the waning crescent moon slips by the planetary pair.   And on the morning of January 8, Venus and Saturn are separated by a mere 0.4 degrees (less than one moon-width).   The celestial dance continues through January so that near month's end, the five planets known as the \"ancients\" span the sky from the southeast to the southwest in the morning twilight.   In order (across the southern sky), these are Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Mars and Jupiter. ", "section": "Education", "day": 1}

In yet another development, in March, the high court refused relief to  Rahul Gandhi  seeking the quashing of a defamation case filed against him by an RSS worker.

During the Bahrain International Airshow, being held at Sakhir Airbase, Bahrain from January 21-23, DRDO along with some of its production partners is displaying Indias strength in advanced defence technology areas, with the aim of exploring the potential of exporting these advanced systems to friendly countries in the region, an official statement said.  The show will witness flying demonstration of the Tejas, the Four plus generation and highly cost effective fighter aircraft, it added.  The Indian Air Force plans to acquire 120 Tejas aircraft, with 100 of them having major modifications to its strike, radar, and mid air refuelling capabilities.  Though the DRDO has developed a naval version of the Tejas, the Navy is seeking a much stronger engine besides other changes.  It would be interesting to see which countries will evince interest in the light combat aircraft since Pakistan has already put out its aircraft JF 17, built in collaboration with China, in the open market.  It is speculated that an Asian country has evinced interest in the Pakistani aircraft.

The organisers said they will have to narrow down on students from Class VII to IX and Class XI as their target group, but people from all age groups are invited to register themselves as delegates.  \"This is an opportunity for all of us, students of science to come together and witness this freshly created concept of a film festival themed around the marvels of Science. Youngsters should utilise this opportunity and participate in the competition Dream to Screen,\" the release read.  The festival will showcase a motley of sci-fi films ranging from \"The Martian\", Russell Crowes \"A Beautiful Mind\", Roland Emmerichs \"2012\" to \"World War Z\", giving sci-fi film lovers a awe-inspiring experience.

At the biggest tennis event of the country, Indias top singles players are expected to be in the singles main draw through wildcards if not by direct entry but this year only Ramkumar Ramanathan has been awarded the lucky entry. Eyebrows were raised when Russias Karen Kachanov (ranked 152) and Andrey Rublev (ranked 172) were handed the singles wild card along with Ramkumar. While Saketh is ranked 170th, Somdev is a few rungs below at 177th in the ATP charts. Yuki Bhambri was the only one who managed a direct entry due to his ranking of 93 in the ATP list but he pulled out after failing to recover from an elbow injury. It leaves only talented youngster Ramkumar, who has been supported by Tamil Nadu Tennis Association (TNTA) for many years now, in the main draw. And it will be the first year when Somdev, who is struggling for form for long, has to take the Qualifying route. \"The ATP sanctions is owned by IMG.

The duo, identified as Prathamesh Pandya and Gunjan Patil, were working as a manager and an employee, respectively, for a company called XDirect, and were arrested on Wednesday, Vadodara city police commissioner E Radhakrishna told PTI today.  They were arrested from the companys office located in Manubhai Tower at Sayajigunj area of Vadodara.  XDirect is registered in Mauritius and its India headquarters is based in Mumbai.  The illegal activity of Dabba trading is also conducted in equities and currencies.  Dabba means box and a dabba operator, in stock market terminology, is the one who indulges in dabba trading. The dabba operators office is like any other brokers office having terminals linked to the stock exchange showing market rates of stocks.  Unlike the main market trade, which now happens online, dabba trading takes place in office, and since it leaves no record, except in the book of the illegal operator, both the buyers and sellers better their margins as they can easily evade any regulatory tax.  As dabba trading is not done on any recognised exchange platform, it is beyond the reach of taxmen or regulators.  Radhakrishna said that a local court has remanded both Pandya and Patil in judicial custody.  He said a team of CID will soon travel to Mumbai, as the companys main office is located there.  The companys Mumbai office, based at suburban Goregaon, could not be contacted as the phone number given is out of order.  The market watchdog, Sebi could not be immediately contacted.  \"Initial information suggests that XDirect, which is registered in Mauritius, has been running the illegal business in the city since February 2014,\" the police commissioner added.  He said this could be the first such instance of illegal trade in foreign currencies being reported from Gujarat.

From the time he was a boy living with his grandparents in Dehradun, surrounded by an assortment of odd animals, people and relatives, to when he gets sent away to school, then makes his way to London and becomes a writer, Rusty had more adventures than one can count.  In \"Rusty and the Magic Mountain,\" published by Puffin Books, Rusty and his friends Pitambar and Popat find adventure in no small measure when they set out to climb a mysterious mountain around which legend and superstition have grown over the years.  On the way they shelter in a haunted rest house, encounter a tiger, and experience a hilarious mule ride which takes them to the palace of a mad Rani who presides over a murder of crows. There are other surprises in store for the boys - a beautiful but mysterious princess, a colony of dwarfs and a wonderful musical stone.  For several decades now, Bonds inimitable stories about Rusty have enthralled and entertained children.  Bond conceived Rusty as a quiet, imaginative and sensitive boy who lives in his grandparents custody in pre-Independence Dehradun. Though he is not the adventurous sort himself, the strangest and most extraordinary things keep happening around him, and so the stories he has to tell are simply fascinating.  The house in Dehra is full of strange creatures. Rusty has to deal with his grandfather?s pet python, who looks into a mirror one day, falls in love with his own reflection, and subsequently spends its days curled up in a narcissistic haze with a dreamy look in its eyes.

In his point by point rebuttal of the charges in the show cause notice slapped on him by the party yesterday, Azad said he had been pursuing the issue of \"corruption\" in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) for the past nine years \"without any let up\" and was not even once told by BJP not to pursue it.  Questioning the partys action against him, he  said that he did not \"name Jaitley or any party person\" in the issue and the party did not depute Jaitley as the DDCA head.  He also made an apparent reference to previous BJP chiefs, saying \"all three respected party presidents also realised that cricket had no connection with our party activities and Jaitleys role in DDCA was his own concern.\" He did not name them.  \"Not one office-bearer apart from Jaitley has reason to feel aggrieved by my or the cricketers (Bishan Singh Bedi and others) complaint of wrongdoings in DDCA, a combative Azad said.  \"Humbly, I do not understand how an individual who has chosen to involve himself in activities that have no connection with the party can later claim the shield of party discipline when instances of wrongdoing in that body are raised and proved,\" says his reply to the party.  He noted that he had told party chief Amit Shah and general secretary, organisation, Ram Lal when he was summoned by them on December 18 that Jaitley was not deputed by BJP to be the DDCA head.  \"In case he chose to be the DDCA president he was opening himself to all associated risks that are entitled in running an organisation and that he could not claim the shield of party position if he got implicated in any mismanagement, fraud and irregularity,\" Azad said in his reply while referring to the meeting.  He had told Shah that he was willing to give all documents regarding the \"corruption in DDCA\" in a joint meeting with Jaitley but neither Shah nor Ram Lal got back to him.  \"Since neither called back I assumed that a cricketing matter had no relation with any party activity and that I will be well within the norms of discipline if I did not name anybody in the party. I did not name Jaitley or any party person,\" he says in his reply, while justifying his decision of holding press conference.  While keeping up the attack on Jaitley, Azad said he had never \"defamed\" the party or its office-bearer, as said by the show cause notice, and insisted that he had been a \"loyal party soldier for last 22 years and I owe my success and identity to BJP\".

Sydney welcomed 2016 with spectacular midnight fireworks as crowds thronged to harbourside vantage points. The city put on a spectacular display centred around the world famous bridge to welcome in 2016.  The display's theme was City of Colour and people gathered around the harbour to watch the 20 minute rainbow spectacular. Red fireworks cascaded off the bridge like a waterfall while yellow flares erupted through the crossing. To complete the effect, the landmark was also transformed into a giant Aboriginal flag. Despite safety concerns, organisers expected a one million plus crowd before the chimes of midnight move across Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Europe and finally the Americas. The show from the Harbour Bridge and Opera House in Australia's largest city is traditionally the world's first major event to ring in the New Year. \"It just keeps getting better every year,\" said Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore, \"with 2,400 more fireworks on the bridge than ever before and a host of exciting new effects lined up\". The 2016 theme is \"City of Colour\" and seven tonnes of fireworks will go up in smoke, including 11,000 shells, 25,000 shooting comets and 100,000 individual \"pyrotechnics effects\". Hong Kong, Beijing, Singapore and other Asian cities may rival Sydney's pyrotechnic splash, but Brunei offers a sober evening after banning Christmas in a shift to hardline Islamic law. Jakarta remained on high alert after anti-terror police foiled detailed plans for an alleged New Year suicide attack in the Indonesian capital. At the heart of Europe, annual festivities and fireworks in Brussels were cancelled as the Belgian capital - home to NATO and the European Union - remained on high alert. \"It's better not to take any risks,\" mayor Yvan Mayeur said yesterday after police arrested two people suspected of plotting to launch attacks during the festivities at Brussels landmarks. The French capital, still reeling from the November 13 slaughter of 130 people, also cancelled its fireworks display. \"The people of Paris and France need this symbolic passage into the New Year,\" said Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo. \"After what our city has lived through, we have to send a signal to the world,\" she told the weekly Journal du Dimanche. In Turkey, police detained two Islamic State suspects allegedly planning to stage attacks in the centre of Ankara. Meanwhile, in Moscow police for the first time closed Red Square where tens of thousands of revellers traditionally gather. London also tried to control the crowds by again charging for access to central riverside areas to see the fireworks, with more than 113,000 USD 15 tickets already sold. -  With agency inputs ALSO READ : Shane Warne enjoys New Year's eve in fancy-dress party ", "section": "Sports", "topics": {"TENNIS": 0.22580645161290322, "TRAIN NETWORK, RAILWAY TRANSPORTATION": 0.12903225806451613}, "day": 1}

Officials associated with the move said public sector honey procuring and processing agencies including Kerala Khadi and Village Industries Board, Kerala Horticulture Corporation and the Forest Department will work for procuring honey from beekeepers and cultivators during the season.  They procure raw honey at the rate of Rs 130 per kg and processed honey at a price of Rs 315 per kg.  \"Kerala, first in the production and the treasure of honey in the country, is all set for honey season beginning from January to April,\" said M Muhammed Haris, Financial Advisor, Kerala Khadi and Village Industries Board.  Noting that Kerala honey has many peculiarities as its ingredients are collected from different type of flowers of various kinds of trees, he said the Kerala Forest Department sells forest honey at a price of Rs 385 per kg.  \"The bees collect honey from teak, rosewood, rubber, Arya vepu, cardamom and vaka. But in Himalayan regions bees procure honey from one type of tree, i.e. Surya Kanthi. The medicinal value of Kerala Honey is known to the country and abroad,\" Haris claimed.  He said the honey collected from Nilambur forests in Malappuram contains gold contents which is good for health of babies.  Haris said the beekeepers from Tamil Nadu also put bee boxes in Kerala especially in Idukki and Palakkad districts and earn lakhs of rupees from honey trade.  \"The farmers from Tamil Nadu put up boxes in coconut groves, rubber, cardamom, cashew, cocoa plantations and collect every five to six days. They will get 10 kg of honey from a box in six days,\" he said.  Haris said there is a lot of scope for beekeeping industry in the country and 300 per cent increase in honey production is not impossible if the government chalked out proper schemes.  \"The US, Canada and China are prominent in the production of honey. The agricultural production will also increase as the rearing of bees will help pollination and fertilization in plants.

China, India, and Indonesia lead the way and will account for almost half of the gains in access globally over the course of the next five years,\" IDC added. The combination of lower-cost devices and inexpensive wireless networks are making accessibility easier in countries with populations that could not previously afford them, it said.  According to Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), India was expected to reach 402 million by December 2015, registering a growth of 49 per cent over 2014. About 306 million of these are expected to access Internet from their mobile devices.  IDC said the global mobile Internet userbase is forecast to grow at two per cent annually through 2020 unless significant new methods of Internet access are introduced.  Efforts by Google, SpaceX, and Facebook among others to make the Internet available to the remaining 4 billion people via high altitude planes, balloons, and satellites are underway.  However, it remains unclear how successful these endeavors will be and when they will be operational at scale, IDC said.  \"Over the next five years, global growth in the number of people accessing the Internet exclusively through mobile devices will grow by more than 25 per cent per year while the amount of time we spend on them continues to grow. This change in the way we access the Internet is fueling explosive growth in mobile commerce and mobile advertising,\" Scott Strawn, Program Director of Strategic Advisory Service said.

We will finalise these guidelines after we receive various suggestions and comments on these draft guidelines.  \"Once finalised, these guidelines will go a long way in promoting organ donation in the country,\" Nadda said.

The hospitals in the NCR cities will be included in the networking along with hospitals of Delhi for organ sharing and allocation.  The statement said that an agreement with the respective state governments and institutions in due course of time, would also be signed.  Organ transplant has two sources - living donor and deceased donor, and in the case of a living donor source, a donor is already decided for a specific recipient.  However for a deceased donor source, recipient needs to be selected out of large recipients pool. The allocation of organ is a complex process, influenced by a number of factors including medical urgency and donor recipient matching, the preamble of the draft said.

The BJP had sent suspended MP Kirti Azad a show cause notice asking him to explain his conduct within 10 days.

Sami had first arrived in India on March 13, 2001 on a visitors visa with the validity of one year which was issued by the Indian High Commission in Islamabad.  His visa was extended from time to time. His Pakistani passport issued on May 27, 2010 expired on May 26, 2015 and his passport was not renewed by the Pakistan government which led him to approach the Indian government with the request to legalise his stay in India.  Samis two songs from the album, Kabhi To Nazar Milao and Lift Kara De, whose music video starred actor Govinda, were a sensation in the early 2000s.  This year the singer tasted success with his song Bhar Do Jholi meri in  Salman Khan -starrer Bajrangi Bhaijaan.

A civil nuclear cooperation agreement with Sri Lanka for peaceful purposes was also signed, paving way to help the SAARC nation by providing technology in areas like nuclear technology.  India also resolved the issue of an alternative site to Russia in Andhra Pradesh for building reactors as against Haripur in West Bengal, which is facing opposition from locals. An agreement between India and Russia was also signed to build Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) units 5 and 6.  Indias uranium concerns too were adequately addressed. In 2015, DAE registered record nuclear fuel production.  In a major development, a civil nuclear cooperation agreement with Australia was brought into force on November 13 along with the Administrative Arrangement for implementing the agreement. The fuel supply arrangements with Canada, Kazakhstan and Australia will bolster energy security by supporting the expansion of nuclear power in India.  India has also received its first consignment of uranium from Canada while efforts to build Australian uranium is underway. However, some uranium mines belonging to Uranium Corporation of India Ltd (UCIL), a PSU under DAE that provide raw nuclear fuel, saw closure due to lack of necessary permissions.  Interestingly, with commissioning of another unit of Kudankulam of 1000 MW and 500 MW of Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor in Kalpakkam, the new year will also witness a lot of activity in the nuclear sector. This will augment 1500 MW of more electricity from nuclear. India is also expected to see signing of agreement between US WestinHouse Co for building six reactors at Chhaya Mithi Virdhi in Gujarat.

At the same time, the existing public and private sector banks would also have to prove their competitiveness in the wake of two entirely new breeds of banks joining the fray in the form of payments and small finance banks this year. At the end of the day, it will be the customers and the quality of services offered to them that will matter and the bankers are almost unanimous that the technology is going to remain the key plank for the banking sector going ahead.  ICICI Banks CEO Chanda Kochhar said the financial sector will see continued innovations based on technology that will deliver enhanced convenience and value to customers. But it is the technology that the new entrants with payments bank license are looking to tap for making a mark in the USD 1.5 trillion banking industry and to challenge the traditional banking models.  State-run SBIs chief Arundhati Bhattacharya, known for being vocal with her views, said the new agile players may have an edge as they are not bound by industry-level wage agreements which can lead to \"a dog-eat-dogs world\". \"Existing universal banks stand to face challenges given the fact that these banks will be coming in without any risk, that they will be coming in with an agile system and delivery models and that they have not been held hostage by industry-level agreements and wage limits,\" she said. Another key issue for the banks in the New Year would be RBIs new diktat for following a uniform method for setting their base lending rates, which follows Governor Raghuram Rajan repeatedly chiding the bankers to ensure passing on full benefits of the central banks repo rate cuts to customers. Banks have so far been known to have been slow in passing on the rate cut benefits, although the hikes in RBIs policy rate get passed on immediately. A sense of unease is there among the bankers on this, but not many of them have spoken out publicly on this, again sans the SBI chief, who said that RBIs repo rate was a \"blunt instrument\" and not very relevant for lenders to adjust their rates. While such run-ins are expected to continue between the banks and the central bank this year, Rajan has shown no signs of relenting on the deadline of March 2017 given to the banks to clean up their balance sheets and banks are most likely to be supportive of his measures in the fight against bad loans, which is estimated to have ballooned to Rs 4 lakh crore or about USD 60 billion.

Security forces in many capitals were on raised alert after a year of militant attacks, including an attack on Paris in November that killed 130 and was claimed by Islamic State (IS). Soldiers were on the streets of the French capital, and police forces in London, Madrid, Berlin and Istanbul increased their presence as Europeans turned out to celebrate the arrival of 2016. In New York, police tightened security for the traditional New Year's Eve dropping of the crystal ball in Times Square, where more than a million people hailed the arrival of 2016. Celebrations in Germany took on a sombre note when police warned of a possible terror attack and evacuated two train stations in Munich an hour before midnight on Thursday. Germany had received a tip from another country's intelligence service that IS planned to attack Munich with up to seven suicide bombers, German officials said at a news conference on Friday. They didn't identify the country that provided the tip-off, but German television said in an unsourced report that it came from France. \"I believe this decision was right because I think we cannot take unnecessary risks when we are dealing with such concrete threats, concrete locations, and a concrete time,\" Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann told a news conference on Friday. The stations - Munich's central station and Pasing station some 8 km (5 miles) away - reopened several hours later after the threat could not be substantiated. In Belgium, police were holding three people for questioning on Thursday as part of an investigation into an alleged plot to carry out an attack in Brussels on New Year's Eve. Authorities on Wednesday called off the usual New Year's Eve fireworks display in the capital, citing fears of a possible militant attack. Police had initially detained six people after searches at six locations in the Belgian capital and one just outside the city. They also seized computers, mobile phones and equipment for airsoft, a sport using guns that shoot non-lethal plastic pellets. Three of the six were released late on Thursday. Prosecutors said they were holding the other three for a further 24 hours. French President Francois Hollande said on Thursday the country was \"not finished with terrorism\" and used a New Year's message to defend controversial plans to strip citizenship from those convicted of terrorism offences. \"The threat is still there,\" he said in a televised address. \"It remains in fact at its highest level, and we are regularly disrupting planned attacks.\" In Istanbul, a bridge between the continents of Europe and Asia, police said they had ramped up the number of officers on the streets by around 10,000. Turkish police on Wednesday detained two suspected Islamic State members they believe to have been plotting New Year's Eve suicide attacks in the capital Ankara, where less than three months ago a double suicide bombing killed more than 100 people. Last year was the deadliest year of militant attacks in Europe since 2004. Evidence that two of the Nov. 13 Paris attackers had entered the continent under cover of a wave of Middle Eastern refugees heightened anxieties over the migration crisis. While many people turned out for public New Year celebrations, the year of militant attacks produced more of a mood of worry and uncertainty for others. \"Normally, I go out to the bars on the Asian side of Istanbul,\" said 26-year-old IT expert Seyda Yilmaz. \"But this year, because of the danger of ISIS (Islamic State), I will spend New Year's Eve in my home.\"", "section": "International", "topics": {"INTERNATIONAL ISSUES": 0.35, "LAW, COURTS, TRIBUNAL": 0.05, "INTERNATIONAL NEWS": 0.1, "TRAIN NETWORK, RAILWAY TRANSPORTATION": 0.125, "NATIONAL SECURITY, TERRORISM, SECURITY AGENCY": 0.15}, "day": 1}

While the buying trends during 2015 witnessed a significant upward movement due to aggressive online discounts, rising fuel prices and wider and abundant choice will hit the e-commerce industry in 2016, it pointed out.  On the other hand, mobile commerce (m-commerce) is growing rapidly as a stable and secure supplement to the e-commerce industry.  Shopping online through smartphones is proving to be a game changer, and industry leaders believe that m-commerce could contribute up to 70 per cent of their total revenues.  The paper reveals that Mumbai ranks first in online shopping followed by Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru and Kolkata.  The study also noted that one out of three customers currently makes transactions through mobiles in Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities.  \"In 2015, 78 per cent of shopping queries were made through mobile devices, compared to 46 per cent in 2013,\" Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat said.  In 2015, the highest growth rate was seen in the apparel segment, almost 69.5 per cent over last year, followed by electronic items, up 62 per cent, baby care products, up 53 per cent, beauty and personal care products at 52 per cent and home furnishings at 49 per cent.  Rapid growth of digital commerce in India is mainly due to increased use of smartphones. Mobiles and mobile accessories have taken up the maximum share of the digital commerce market in India, noted the study.  Moreover, almost 45 per cent online shoppers reportedly preferred cash on delivery over credit cards (16 per cent) and debit cards (21 per cent). Only 10 per cent opted for internet banking and a scanty 7 per cent preferred cash cards, mobile wallets, and other such modes of payment.  The 18-25 years of age group has been the fastest growing age segment online with user growth being contributed by both male and female segments.  The survey highlights that 38 per cent of regular shoppers are in 18-25 age group, 52 per cent in 26-35, 8 per cent in 36-45 and 2 per cent in the age group of 45-60. Nearly 65 per cent online shoppers are male and 35 per cent female.

The League, revived after a gap of two years following a successful inaugural Indian Badminton League in 2013, has brought in the fresh idea in which each of the competing teams will nominate one match in each tie as their Trump Card.  A victory by the team that picked the particular game as its Trump will provide it with one extra point but a defeat will set it back by one point, and the intrigue generated by this new concept would keep the ties alive till the end, according to national coach Pullela Gopichand.  \"Its a great addition to the league to ensure that the excitement remains till the end of the tie. Two teams can nominate the same match as Trump match. This ensures that the last two matches are also important in a tie,\" said Gopichand here in the run-up to the League opener.  \"Even a 3-0 lead is not sufficient to win as you still can lose the tie. Spectators interest will be kept alive. It needs to be seen how the players react to the extra pressure. Some play better under pressure and some others crack,\" he said.  World no. 2 Saina, who commanded USD 100,000 at the auction, would be leading Awadhe Warriors challenge against Mumbai Rockets who appear strong in mens singles with two top men shuttlers of the country - H S Prannoy and R M V Gurusaidutt - leading their charge.  The host outfit has a strong mens doubles players in Denmarks Mathias Boe and Russias Vladimir Ivanov.  World no. 20, Prannoy, has already sounded upbeat about his teams chances.  \"Over the last two years I have been playing really well, along with Gurusaidutt. We both are in good form. We are a pretty balanced outfit. We have really good doubles players too,\" said the 23-year-old, who hails from Kerala, here ahead of the tournament opener.

As the number of private cars in the streets of Delhi went down nearly by half, prompting many people to take public transport, this social media provided live information to help people reach their destinations conveniently.  Many commuters, not so accustomed to taking public transport and being used to travel in private vehicles, were not at ease with the situation.  But, Twitter came in handy for such tech-savvy people, giving them live information, from bus routes to metro links and last-mile connectivity.  For getting the desired information, the user had to tweet the origin and destination with a specified format on the Twitter handle of Delhi Transport Department, and in return it provided the route information, including the distance, estimated time of travel and a weather update.  So, if the commuter had to travel from Lajpat Nagar to Connaught Place, the format is -- @TransportDelhi Origin (Lajpat Nagar) to Destination (Connaught Place) #PollutionFreeDelhi.  \"Starting today commuters would get real-time information on shortest routes, options of public transport available between two points, fare details, traffic situation and current weather conditions.  \"If users want to keep their location and travel details private you can send a direct message to @TransportDelhi and receive the information privately,\" said a statement jointly released by the Delhi government and Twitter today.  The Delhi government has entered into an agreement with the micro-blogging site, seeking to help commuters find information about bus routes, metro, autorickshaws during the road-rationing experiment.  Twitter users can get details of public transport available in particular areas by tweeting #pollutionfreeDelhi followed by the departure and destination point. Twitter will instantly send users real-time public transport updates pertaining to the area.  Social media, including both Facebook and Twitter, was today abuzz with excitement as the road-rationing experiment came into force, with many commuters sharing real-time pictures of relatively less congested streets and probable \"violators\".  \"#DelhiOddEven @htTweets @ArvindKejriwal @DelhiTrafficPol even car on odd day.

Besides, teachers in government-run schools will be provided better facilities and their postings would be in their native place or nearest to it.

The PCC president said it was part of his overall plan to revamp and overhaul education system in the state.  He also expressed concern over \"poor results\" in government schools.  \"Our teachers in the government schools are well-qualified and hardworking and still the results are not good\", he claimed, adding, he will be meeting the teachers to seek their viewson this matter.  The former Punjab chief minister said, while improving infrastructure in the government-run educational institutions, opinion of teachers would also be sought. Besides, their working condition will also be improved.  He agreed with a suggestion that the teachers should be posted within a particular radius of their home and there must not be any favouritism or vindictiveness in posting of the teachers.  \"Ideally a teacher must not be posted very far from the school, he or she is working at, and we will try to work out a system where teachers feel happy and satisfied at the place of their posting and they focus all their energies on educating the students\", he said, while responding to a suggestion by some teachers who had come along with the students.  Amarinder said, he had started this system during his regime that the teachers were preferably posted in their own villages and if there were no schools, then they were posted in the second nearest place.  He said this creates a strong bond between the students and the teachers.  He claimed that although the Akalis have \"stopped\" this system, his government will \"resume\" it.

The polls to the civic body in Hyderabad assume significance in view of the size and demographic profile of the city.  There are as many as 24 Assembly constituencies under the GHMC limits with a population of about 65 lakh. There have been allegations that the number of voters exceeded the population in GHMC.  The GHMC polls, likely to be held in the coming few weeks, are a litmus test for the ruling TRS as the party has not been known to be a major force in the city.  TRS did not contest the last GHMC elections in 2009 and is keen to win the coming elections to prove its complete domination in Telangana.  A majority of assembly segments under GHMC limits have been won by the opposition TDP-BJP nominees though some of the TDP MLAs switched loyalty to the TRS.  The TRS had kicked off its campaign for the poll much ahead of its rivals with a number of hoardings on the governments achievements installed at different locations in the city.  The TRS government had also announced property tax exemption for certain sections and other decisions like regularisation of contract staff and fresh recruitment in government departments.  In an informal chat with mediapersons, Telangana IT and Panchayat Raj Minister K T Rama Rao, son of Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, today said the TRS government has put the city firmly on the path of making it a world-class city.

Claiming innocence, Remo in his plea has stated that he was being \"falsely implicated\" in the case.  He pointed out that the girl, who was hit by his son, Johans car, had demanded Rs 3 lakh from him as against the Rs 50,000 which he had offered in compensation.

In case the states voluntarily agree to undertake cuts in kerosene allocation, beyond the savings due to DBT, a similar incentive will be given to those States/UTs, the statement said.  \"While implementing DBT, states have been advised to take all necessary steps to ensure that eligible/genuine beneficiaries particularly in rural areas are able to access their full entitlement of kerosene. Special care should also be taken in areas having irregular power supply,\" it said.  Stating that the scheme will be implemented with effect from April 1, 2016, it said the state governments will be consulted in the meantime before operationalising the scheme. The working of the scheme will also be reviewed after three months of implementation.  The National Sample Survey 2011-12 indicates that the total consumption of kerosene in the country, including both open market and PDS kerosene, was 71.30 lakh kilolitres.  Even though consumption of kerosene has been coming down over the years, 86.85 lakh kilolitres of subsidized PDS kerosene has been allocated to the states in the year 2015-16, which is higher than the total household kerosene demand in the country.  \"Thus, there is evidence that some part of the kerosene allocation is diverted for non-eligible purposes,\" the statement said.  Also, there has been a major increase in coverage of power supply through electrification of villages. Nearly 45 lakh new LPG connections have also been given to the poor.  These measures, it said, have reduced the demand for kerosene, both for lighting and cooking purposes.

Justice Janak Raj Kotwal passed the order yesterday on a petition filed by Dr Javed Chowdhary, who laid claim to the post of the Principal based on his seniority.  Dr Rafiq Pampori resigned as Principal of the Medical College last month and sought voluntary retirement alleging that he was not being consulted on important decisions relating the college.  Ignoring the seniority list, the government appointed Dr Qaiser Ahmad Koul -- junior to Dr Chowdhary -- as acting Principal in his own pay and grade.  \"It shall not create any right, interest or equity in favour of the doctor for his promotion, as and when appointment/promotion to the post of Principal, Government Medical College, Srinagar will be made\" in accordance with the provisions of the rules for recruitment, the government order issued on December 19 said.  The court directed that the \"competent authority (government) shall accord consideration to filling up the post of the Principal, Government Medical College within a period of four weeks hereafter on regular basis having regard to the rule position.  \"In case that is not done for any reason, whatsoever, the impugned order shall stay and it shall be open for the respondents (competent authority) to make fresh temporary arrangement in which seniority shall prevail,\" it said.  Justice Kotwal said, \"Although the government has not given any reason for not following the seniority list while making the temporary appointment, the incidence of high infant mortality at G B Pant Hospital here in 2011 is believed to be held against Dr Chowdhary, who was Medical Superintendent of the institution at that time.\"  However, Dr Chowdhary was cleared of all charges by an inquiry conducted by senior IAS officer Bipul Pathak.  \"It is clear that Dr Chowdhary made efforts to improve functioning of the hospital and there is nothing which lends credence to the charge of lack of supervision, dereliction of duties, negligence and lack of devotion to duties by Dr Chowdhary,\" Pathak said in his report.  The IAS officer also recommended a full-fledged inquiry against the senior faculty member and now acting Principal, Dr Qaiser Koul.  Dr Pampori, who was to superannuate in February 2014, was given one-year extension to his services by the previous NC-Congress government and later benefited from the governments decision to enhance the retirement age for medical faculty from 58 years to 62 years.  The extension to Dr Pampori was given by the  Omar Abdullah -led government despite its own Cabinet decision in April 2013 to do away with the practice.

Artiste Pradip Guptas installation titled \"Homage,\" he says, \"is dedicated to Mohammad Ikhlaqs family.\"  Ikhlaq (50) was lynched and his 22-year-old son was severely injured in Uttar Pradeshs Dadri district last year after rumours spread in the area about the family storing and consuming beef.  Guptas artwork comprises of a mechanically erected pumping heart that inflates and deflates representing its beats.  The artist expresses his anguish at the incident through this piece of art, for Guptas heart is made out of \"cow leather\" and to represent the \"alarming communal scenario\" prevailing in the country, he has placed it beside a basil (tulsi) plant that is considered auspicious by the Hindus.  Other participating artists include Atul and Anju Dodiya, Meera Devidayal, Lalitha Lajmi, the recently deceased Hema Upadhyay, Jitish Kallat and Reena Saini Kallat among others.  The exhibition also has a section titled \"Assault on Reason\" which is a graphic compilation of the newspaper and magazine reports about several incidents including the FTII tussle, the Award Wapsi campaign and earlier instances of hate speech, Love Jihad and the ban on the novel by Tamil author Perumal Murugan.  \"These are all press reports on or related to what has been happening in the country in past one-one and a half years,\" Rahman says.

The UAVs designed for plateau missions are usually installed with high span chord ratio wings, which provides more lifting force at a relatively low airspeed.  The UAVs employ high span chord ratio wings, however, tend to lose their manoeuvrability. Hence, they usually need larger turning radius and are unable to maintain the altitude during sharp slope turning as the lifting force produced by the wings decrease dramatically when the bank angle is large.  The discarding of the flight performances may risk the safety of the flight in plateau mountain regions.  Variable thrust direction (VTD) technology is a type of thrust vectoring control (TVC) approach that allows to manipulate the directions of thrust to the fuselage of the aircraft.  Most of the existing works are designed for jet engines, which cannot be applied to the conventional propeller engine aircraft.  Researchers from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in China developed a novel VTD mechanism to the conventional propeller engine UAV, which allows redirecting parts portion of the thrust from the propeller engine to other directions rather than normal axial direction.  A combination flight controller for the VTD enhanced UAV is then proposed to coordinate the VTD controlled forces and aerodynamic surfaces forces.  The proposed variable thrust direction mechanism consists of a conventional propeller engine which is mounted on a two dimensional rotate disk driven by two servo actuators.  By combining the linear motions of the actuator, both the azimuth and the altitude angle of the disk with respect to the fuselage can be controlled, and thus changing the thrust direction of the propeller.  By the introduction of the VTD capability to the conventional propeller UAV, the manoeuvrability of the UAV has been greatly enhanced, since the VTD engine enables direct force control of the aircraft.  The newly developed VTD UAV was applied to implement plateau missions, which demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed technique.  The research was published in the journal Science China Information Sciences.

The plea was rejected by Principal Judge P B Desai, presiding over the Special NIA Court here, after the accused - Haji Patel, Mohammad Yunus Shaikh and Abid Patel - declined to give consent to undergo polygraph test.  During arguments today, their lawyer citied various orders of the Supreme Court as well as High Court in this regard and argued that consent of the accused is necessary to conduct lie detection test.  NIA produced a total of six accused in the Court after the expiry of their remand. Besides the trio, the others are Mohsin Khan, Mohammad Altaf and Nisar Ahmed.  As the Central agency did not seek further remand, the court sent all the accused in 14-day judicial custody.  The two BJP leaders - Shirish Bangali and Pragnesh Mistry - were shot dead by two unidentified gunmen in Bharuch, about 200km from here, on November 2.  Bangali was a former President of Bharuch district unit of BJP, while Mistry served as General Secretary of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha.  Initial probe by Gujarat Police revealed the contract for killing the BJP leaders was given allegedly by fugitive underworld don Javed Chikna, apparently to avenge communal riots in Mumbai and Gujarat in 1993 and 2002, respectively.  Based on a request of Gujarat Government, Union Home Ministry handed over the probe in the murders to NIA, which handles terror cases, last month.

The nations largest lender also ruled out going ahead with its share sale plan this fiscal.  Last October, SBI had reduced its base rate by 40 basis points, from 9.70 per cent per to 9.30 per cent.  \"I dont really think (base rate will be cut) so, but maybe once we cross the year end then we will see,\" SBI Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya told reporters after opening the second InTouch branch at Colaba in South Mumbai.  The rate reduction by SBI was following a 50 bps repo rate cut by the RBI on September 29.  Earlier this week, private sector HDFC Bank reduced its base rate by 0.05 per cent to 9.30 per cent, matching with that of SBI, 5 bps lower than its private sector rival ICICI Bank, which is maintaining its minimum lending rate at 9.35 per cent.  Talking about the new base rate calculation based on the marginal cost of funds, Bhattacharya said the formula will not make a huge amount of difference on base rate but will help in transmission. \"Some more amount of transmission will definitely happen but I dont think it is going to be humongous.\"  However, many analysts have pegged an 80-160 bps reduction in base rate by banks from April when the new method will be in force.  On the Rs 12,000-crore follow-on public offer that the bank is planning to raise, she said SBI is unlikely to raise the money in this fiscal. The bank had been planning this OFS sale even in last fiscal as market was not conducive.  \"I dont think we have any clear plans now. I dont think it will happen this fiscal year but then lets see.\"  After a meeting of its Committee of Directors on December 21, 2015, the bank had said in a regulatory filing that it had got permission to raise up to Rs 12,000 crore by selling Basel-III compliant tier-II bonds on a private placement basis.  Following this, SBI had on December 24 raised Rs 4,000 crore through tier-II bonds on private placement basis under the Basel-III norms.  On the RBI deadline of March 2017 to clean up the balancesheets, Bhattacharya said the banks are in dialogue with the RBI.

The formalities for a tie-up between BJP and United People's Front (UPF), a forum of nine tribal and indigenous organisations that will contest 30 seats in the 2016 Assembly polls, are now being worked on. The first step towards this direction was a meeting on December 5 between Modi and Hagrama Mohilary, the chief of Bodoland People's Front (BPF), the prime force behind the tribal forum. Interestingly, BPF, which has 10 seats in the current Assembly, was part of the Congress-led Assam government between 2006 and 2014. In fact, the 2016 Assam Assembly polls will be a story of old friends joining forces against each other. Himanta Biswa Sarma, the one-time trusted lieutenant of Chief Minister  Tarun Gogoi  joined BJP in August and has emerged as the prime challenger to the 14-year-long Congress rule in the state. It was Sarma who took Mohilary to meet the prime minister. To counter Sarma, who happened to be strategist-inchief for Congress in 2006 and 2011 Assembly polls, Gogoi has recently roped in professional election manager Prashant Kishor, who has been widely credited for  Nitish Kumar 's return to power for third time in November. The deal between Kishor, who had a brief stint in  Rahul Gandhi 's office earlier, and Congress was reportedly struck by Nitish Kumar. The fact that Kishor's wife hails from Assam also helped as Gogoi was the first to reach out to Kishor's fatherin-law, immediately after the Bihar election results. As a foil to Kishor, the BJP has now enrolled services of Rajat Sethi, a former aide of Kishor. The Harvard-educated Sethi was part of Kishor's Citizens for Accountable Governance, which handled Narendra Modi's campaign for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. To start with Sethi has conceived a series of dialogue called \"Assam Nirman\" to take the BJP's action plan for development of Assam. Team Sethi also has Shubhrastha, a former journalist who was also part of Modi's 2014 campaign, and two IIT Kharagpur graduates - Mahendra Shukla and Ashish Sogani. The BJP, however, is reluctant to play it up as Sethi vs Kishor battle. \"We have hired him to manage the social media accounts. He is not a strategist. In fact, the Assam Nirman idea came from a young BJP worker from Dibrugarh district,\" says a senior leader of the Assam unit of BJP. Kishor, who was also instrumental in fine-tuning the Grand Alliance in Bihar, is now exploring the probability of such a coalition in Assam among Congress, AIUDF and AGP. Congress is, however, split wide open over the issue of a pre-poll alliance with AIUDF, a party which was founded by perfume baron Baduruddin Ajmal in 2005. With 18 seats, AIUDF is the largest opposition party in the state.  Many in Congress believe that an alliance with AIUDF, which is perceived to be a party to protect the interest of alleged illegal Bangladeshi infiltrators, will consolidate Hindu votes in favour of BJP. However, Team Kishor believes that intelligent seatsharing between AIUDF and Congress will be the best bet to stop BJP's surge in the state. Apart from winning seven out of 14 Lok Sabha seats in 2014, the BJP also outperformed the Congress in municipal polls in February this year.

Rubabuddin had sought withdrawal of the petition on grounds of ill-health.  On December 30, 2014, a CBI court in Mumbai had discharged Shah in the alleged fake encounter cases saying there existed \"no case\" against him and that he had been implicated for \"political reasons\".  The high court in 2015 transferred the probe in the Dabholkar murder case to CBI and that of Pansare to a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of State CID after local police failed to make any progress in the investigations.  Dabholkar and Pansares family members had approached the high court seeking probe by independent agencies.  Hearing another petition, the high court ruled in March that sedition charges cannot be invoked against persons writing or saying anything in criticism of the government and its measures as far as it does not incite violence or cause public disorder.  A bench headed by the then Chief Justice Mohit Shah held that citizens have the right to say or write anything criticising the government and its measures so long as it does not incite violence or create law and order problems.  The ruling was passed in a PIL filed after the arrest of cartoonist Aseem Trivedi on sedition charges for drawing cartoons that allegedly insulted the national emblem and Parliament.  Soon after the ruling, the Maharashtra government issued a circular but later withdrew it after facing severe flak from the general public.  The high court is currently conducting civil trial in a suit filed by late Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackerays estranged son Jaidev challenging his fathers will.  In his last will of December 13, 2011, Bal Thackeray has not left a farthing to Jaidev. Aggrieved Jaidev has disputed the will, saying that his father was of unsound mind and that his brother Uddhav, who is now heading the political party, influenced him.  The high court also began final hearing into a suit filed by Khuzaima Qutbuddin, who claims to be the 53rd Dai al-Mutlaq and head of the Dawoodi Bohra community, seeking to be declared as the Syedna.  Qutbuddin had filed the suit last year seeking relief against Mufaddal Saifuddin, the second son of the late Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin. Mohammed Burhanuddin passed away on January 17, 2014 at the age of 102. Mufaddal Saifuddin then took over as Syedna.  Qutbuddin claimed that the late Syedna (Burhanuddin) had chosen him his Mazoon (deputy) and secretly appointed him as his successor 50 years ago.

Default by two of the highly leveraged corporates can result in capital losses of 9 per cent and 13 per cent losses can occur if the top three borrowers default, warns the report.  \"Corporate sector vulnerabilities and the impact of their weak balance sheets on the financial system need closer monitoring,\" Governor Rajan said in the report.  The report also notes that contribution of large borrowers to total bad loans and restructured accounts, which crossed 11.1 per cent of the system, is a whopping 87 per cent as of the September quarter, up from 78.2 per cent a year ago.  \"Asset quality and capital are the two important factors for the banking sector and some new beginnings have been made on those fronts. However, the pace of reforms is still slow,\" Icra senior vice-president Vibha Batra said.  Worried over the rising tide of bad loans, Rajan in the December policy announcement set a deadline to state-run banks to clean up their bloated balance-sheets by FY17.  The government on the other hand has been taking a number of steps to revive the health of public sector lenders. At the same time, Prime Minister  Narendra Modi  has made it clear that the lazy banking must come to an end, as he asked bankers to run the banks professionally without any outside influence. The RBI has also given the banks more tools to speed up recovery from stressed assets in the form of strategic debt restructuring, which allows banks to convert a part their debt into equity of defaulting firms.

This was announced by the state government today to deal with the menace of drunken driving and also reduce accidents on roads.  Speaking to reporters here at Mantralaya, Transport Minister Diwakar Raote said in 24 hours beginning on New Year eve, Traffic Police registered 10,534 offences. Of these, 705 related to drunken driving, 1,906 to driving without helmets 1,906 and 7,923 were related to other violations.  \"In view of the constant registration of higher number of cases of drunken driving, the government has decided to suspend driving licences of the offenders for three months.  \"A similar action will be taken against those found indulging in rash and over-speeding, jumping traffic signals, overloading goods vehicles, carrying passengers in goods vehicles and speaking on mobile phones while driving,\" Raote said.  The minister said wearing of helmets on two-wheelers shall be made mandatory all over the state. Those found not using helmets or wearing seat belts while driving will have to compulsorily attend two hours of counselling sessions.  The Minister said his endeavour was to drastically reduce incidents of drunken driving and traffic violations.  In Mumbai, 16,324 cases of drunken driving were recorded in 2011. Last year, this number stood at 14,602, he said.  After the installation of CCTvs in Mumbai, the Traffic Department will now depute officers of the Regional Transport Office (RTO) to act against road rule violations, he said.  Referring to the governments decision to re-issue 60,000 permits of autorickshaws in major cities like Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nashik and Nagpur, he said they will be issued online.  \"Five per cent of the permits to be allotted have been reserved for women,\" the minister said.  Raote further said the condition of one year driving experience for women autorickshaw drivers has been waived.  He said the applicants will have to be a domicile of the state for 15 years and should have knowledge of Marathi language.

In a letter to Finance Minister  Arun Jaitley , Railway Minister  Suresh Prabhu  cited the prevailing financial position of railways, efforts at cost cutting and possible gradual adjustment of fares and other non-tariff revenue measures to absorb the impact while requesting the exchequers help for implementation of the Commission recommendations.  \"I would therefore earnestly request you to help the Ministry of Railways and handhold it for the implementation of 7th CPC recommendations,\" the Railway Minister said in the letter.  \"This may be done either through compensation of loss for coaching services (Rs 31,727 crore in 2013-14) or directly by virtue of a revenue grant, matching the amount of the 7th CPCs liability placed upon railways for the next 3-4 years,\" he said.  Prabhu hoped that during this 3-4 years period, railways would be able to absorb the impact from their resources through gradual adjustment of fares and other non-tariff revenue measures.  However, Railway Minister has expressed his reservation about increasing the freight rate in the given scenario contending that it would have a \"deleterious impact\" on national economy.  He said, \"In order to maintain these expenses at the current proportion - at 51.5 per cent of the gross receipts, the railway revenues will need to grow substantially by 40 per cent in 2016-17 which is well nigh impossible given the fact that till October 2015 growth was only 8.4 per cent.  \"The first factor of freight earnings originating loading is demand driven and is largely not within the control of railways. The second factor that is freight rates, though is within railways competence, there is hardly any headroom available for increasing the same without affecting railways competitiveness adversely.\"  He said, \"Moreover, exercising this option will have a deleterious impact on the national economy as well as on critical sectors such as coal, cement, foodgrains.\" MORE PTI ARU RT", "section": "Finance", "topics": {"FINANCE, BANK": 0.0967741935483871, "ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY, FINANCE MINISTRY": 0.3870967741935484, "GOVERNMENT, GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS": 0.22580645161290322, "TRAIN NETWORK, RAILWAY TRANSPORTATION": 0.1935483870967742}, "day": 1}

It comes in a State where schools remain closed for three months due to a harsh winter. Inaugurating the initiative at Srinagar\u2019s Government Girls High School, Hyderpora, where 10th and 12th standard students will be provided free coaching with state-of-the-art facilities like Central Heating System and free Wi-Fi, State Education Minister Naeem Akhtar said, \u201cIt is Chief Minister Mufti Muhammad Sayeed\u2019s dream to remove the restlessness in our hearts and minds and to revive the glorious academic culture in J&K that has left imprints across the globe.\u201d The initiative is open for both government as well as private school students.", "section": "Education", "topics": {"WEATHER, CALAMITIES": 0.13043478260869565, "EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION, EDUCATIONAL ISSUES": 0.43478260869565216, "GOVERNMENT, GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS": 0.21739130434782608, "EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTES, ENTREPRENEURSHIPS, RESEARCH": 0.08695652173913043}, "day": 1}

The prices have declined from the peak of Rs 200 per kg in October to Rs 160 at present due to various government measures including unearthing of hoarded stock and offloading that in the retail market.   Prices of key pulses, especially   tur  and urad, shot up unabated in the last few months due to a fall in domestic output by 2 million tonnes in 2014-15 crop year (July-June) because of deficit monsoon.   As per reports received from the state governments, till yesterday, 1,12,545.96 tonne of   pulses  seized under de-holding operations have been auctioned or offloaded through other options in the market to increase availability. This will help moderate the prices further, an official statement said today.   \"Since imposition of the stockholding limits on pulses by the states, 1,31,029.55 tonnes of pulses have been seized so far.

As many as 14,726 raids were conducted against hoarders of pulses in 14 states and an union territory.   As per the data, a maximum of 86,709 tonnes of pulses were seized in Maharashtra, of which 81,473 tonnes have been offloaded till yesterday.   Karnataka has offloaded 22,421 tonnes of pulses out of the total seized quantity of 25,545 tonnes so far, while   Chhattisgarh  has released more than 4,138 tonnes.

The fall in core sector output may curb industrial growth, which reached a five-year high of 9.8% in October.   The eight infrastructure sectors that make up the core sector index - coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertilisers, steel, cement and electricity - together have a 38% weightage in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP).   \"Industrial production data would have been anyway weak because of base effect but now, it will be all the more weak,\" said Crisil chief economist DK Joshi.   The contraction in core sector output is in sharp contrast to the 8.5% growth last November, data released by the Ministry of Commerce & Industry showed. The Index of Eight Core Industries had increased 3.2% in October.   Steel production declined 8.4% in November, dropping for the fifth consecutive month. Other sectors with lower output were cement (-1.8%), crude oil (-3.3%) and natural gas (-3.9%).    The fertilisers sector was the clear outlier with growth of 13.5% last month, while coal output rose 3.5%. Electricity generation was the same as last year. The core sector's cumulative growth during April to November period was 2%.   \"Overall, the weaker performance of key lead indicators such as the core sector, merchandise exports and automobile production in November as compared to the previous month portend a sharp dip in   IIP  growth as compared to the robust 9.8% recorded in October 2015,\" said Aditi Nayar, senior economist at   ICRA .   Part of the contraction in core sector output can be attributed to the fewer number of working days as compared with November 2014 and the shift in the festive calendar. The peak Diwali festival was in October last year.   The last time core sector growth fell was in April, when it shrank by 0.4%.   Joshi said that while bottlenecks in coal production have been removed, excess capacity in cement and steel, along with imports in the latter, had made them uncompetitive. \"The dip in cement and steel production correlate with the overall weak   economy ,\" Joshi said.   \"The continuing sluggishness in exports and rural demand, the narrow recovery in infrastructure and the relatively brighter outlook for urban demand continue to point towards moderate industrial growth in the second half of   FY16 ,\" Nayar said.

The e-District project, aimed at digitising government services and records was also launched. The government also distributed compensation cheques to families hit by 1984 anti-Sikh riots on the 31st anniversary of the violence and later enhanced the amount to Rs 5 lakh.  The Winter session of the Assembly saw the passing of key legislations like the Jan Lokpal, and three education bills, with an eye on reining in private schools and scrapping of no detention policy till class VIII.  A fresh round of confrontation started in December once Jung, in his communication to the MHA, questioned the legality of a Commission of Inquiry to probe alleged irregularities in DDCA, an issue over which the AAP is training its guns on Finance Minister  Arun Jaitley , demanding his resignation.  In September, Jung had directed all officers, including IAS and DANICS, not to follow the Delhi government orders which were declared by the Centre as \"null and void\".  Before that, in late August, the Home Ministry declared as \"legally invalid and void\" the Delhi government-constituted Commission of Inquiry to probe into the alleged CNG fitness scam, saying it was not the \"competent authority\" to set up any such panel.  Following CBI raids at the Secretariat on December 15, Kejriwal took on Modi calling him a \"psychopath\" and \"coward\" and targeted Jaitley over alleged corruption in Delhis cricket body under his watch. He also demanded the Prime Ministers resignation for \"getting the raids conducted\".  Amid charges and counter-charges, Kejriwal claimed his office was raided which was denied by CBI as well as Jaitley in Rajya Sabha where the Opposition created an uproar. The chief minister claimed he was in fact the target and that Principal Secretary Rajendra Kumar was just an excuse.  Another highlight of the year was the ever-widening rift between the Delhi Police and the ruling AAP. Demanding authority over police, \"at least for a year\", the party routinely assailed police commissioner B S Bassi of working as an \"agent\" of the Centre.

The dispute resolution panel (DRP), set up under the income tax act as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, had disallowed exemptions under various heads, including network site rentals, annual license fee, unaccounted income, depreciation on 3G spectrum and transfer pricing adjustments on advertisements and marketing expenses.  It had also referred the matter back to the assessing officer (AO).  A bench of justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and Sanjeev Sachdeva last week allowed the AO to pass the assessment order but asked him not to give effect to it till the next date of hearing on February 18.  The court also issued notice to the Centre, DRP and the Income Tax (IT) department and sought their replies on Vodafones plea alleging that the panels November 16 order disallowing the exemptions was \"illegal and arbitrary\" and contrary to provisions of the IT Act.  The AO had in March 2015 passed a draft assesssment order, disallowing the exemptions sought by Vodafone.  The draft order was challenged by the company before the DRP which on November 16, had disallowed the objections raised by it and remanded back the matter back to the AO, the petition filed by Vodafone said.  The telecom major has contended that the panel, while disallowing the objections, had said that the proposed addition of over Rs 2800 crore has to be made to its taxable income for the AY 2011-12.

In a statement issued by him today, the senior Congress leader said the government was itself at fault behind the deadlock over the important legislature.  \"The government has not been able to find a way to accommodate the views of the Opposition and pass the GST Bill. I am afraid the government has only to blame itself and its stubborn and unbending attitude,\" Chidambaram said. The Good and Services Tax is the biggest indirect tax reform since 1947. This will be levied on manufacture sale and consumption of goods and services. On 17th December 2014, the NDA government made slight changes to it and redefined it in the Lok Sabha. The bill was approved in Lok Sabha but is currently stuck in the Rajya Sabha because the government does not hold a majority there. Here is the full text of Chidambaram's statement: Economy stuck in a groove First, the economy.  At the beginning of 2015, the Government had confidently predicted that the economy will grow at 8.1 to 8.5 per cent in 2015-16. Many promises of the government -- more jobs, greater investment and quicker infrastructure development -- were premised on a high growth of GDP. I am afraid none of the promises has materialized. On the contrary, 2015 has ended on a somber and subdued note.  For the whole of 2015-16, GDP growth is not likely to be higher than 7 to 7.3 percent, which means that it will be the same as, or lower than, in 2014-15. The economy is stuck in a groove.  The mid-year economic analysis of the Economics Division of the Ministry of Finance has candidly admitted that private investment and exports -- two of the four drivers of demand - are languishing. The Indian economy is like a car running on two wheels. Corporate balance sheets are stressed, net sales have fallen by 5.3 per cent, and profit after tax is flat. Non-food credit growth at 8.3 per cent is the slowest in 20 years. Growth of credit to industry is 4.6 per cent while credit to medium enterprises has actually shrunk by 9.1 per cent.  Exports have recorded twelve successive months of decline compared to the same month of the previous year. This is unprecedented. Distress in rural India  There is acute distress in rural India, especially in the farm sector. Explicit and deliberate policy decisions of the government have resulted in rural wage growth remaining muted. Minimum support prices have been kept deliberately low. Net sown area for the Rabi season is lower than for the corresponding period of last year. The mid-year Analysis has warned that there are downside risks to agricultural production this year.  Just travel through rural India and talk to people in the villages. There is deep resentment about the tardy implementation of MGNREGA, the cut in the average number of days of work and the delayed payment of wages. Crop insurance is unavailable to most farmers. The old age pension scheme has been severely pruned. Banks are reluctant to give jewel loans. Education loans have practically stopped, and the demand for security has discouraged many students and parents from applying for loans. People are unable to point to any central government scheme that is being vigorously implemented. Panchayats are starved of funds. The anger and angst of rural India was reflected in the recent elections.  Urban India, jobs  Urban India is not much better. Rising prices, especially of food, transport, electricity and water; increase in crime; lack of jobs; and growing intolerance have caused much grief and fear among the people. Women, children and senior citizens have been especially affected.  There is no evidence that the promised jobs are being created. The 26th quarterly employment survey conducted between April and June 2015 showed that job creation in the manufacturing and export-oriented sectors fell by a net of 43,000 from the previous quarter. In the same period of 2014, these sectors had added 182,000 jobs.  The government does not seem confident of meeting the fiscal deficit target of 3.9 per cent for the current financial year. For 2016-17, the government seems to be toying with the idea of departing from the path of fiscal consolidation -- already delayed by a year. These are ominous signals, and I would like to caution the government against following an ill-advised policy. Political climate  After the Bihar elections, there were initial signs that the government would reach out to the Opposition and adopt a consensual approach. That hope was short-lived. As a result, many important legislation remain stalled in Parliament. Let me take the example of the GST legislation. The Congress and some other parties had objected to some provisions of the Bill on weighty and well-reasoned grounds. The government was outright dismissive, until the Chief Economic Adviser virtually endorsed two of the three principal objections and made no recommendation on the third. Yet, the government has not been able to find a way to accommodate the views of the Opposition and pass the GST Bill. I am afraid the government has only to blame itself and its stubborn and unbending attitude.  The government has shown no willingness to engage with the Opposition on any important issue. Whether it is the conduct of foreign policy, relations with neighbouring countries, the rise of intolerance, communal violence, threats to internal security, momentous legal issues pending in Courts or charges of corruption or misconduct, the government seems to have forgotten that India is a parliamentary democracy and the government is accountable every day to Parliament. In our view, the overbearing attitude of the government is mainly responsible for the frequent disruptions in Parliament and the absence of cooperation outside Parliament.  Foreign relations I wish to make particular mention of the troubled relations with Pakistan, Nepal and the Maldives. On Pakistan, more and more people are asking if the government has a clear and consistent policy at all. In Nepal, India seems to have lost the goodwill of all concerned -- the Government of Nepal, the Madhesi parties and the people of Nepal who have suffered immense hardship over the last four months. Rhetoric, U-turns, and impulsive steps do not make a coherent foreign policy.  The people of India are not impressed by the numerous visits made by the Prime Minister to foreign countries. People have begun to ask hard questions on the gains made through these visits. When anything is overdone, there are not only diminishing returns, but it also invites ridicule, as you will find from a cursory survey of the social media.  The role of the opposition  The Congress, and other parties, are in the Opposition. The role of the Opposition in a Parliamentary democracy is well articulated in the old maxim \"to oppose, expose and depose.\" Our opposition to the government's wrong policies or poorly-drafted laws or ill-conceived schemes or acts of misconduct or misuse of government agencies cannot be termed obstructionism.  Let me remind everyone that we have cooperated with the government in passing 67 and 45 Bills in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, respectively, during the last 19 months. The Congress holds that peace and harmony, economic development and social welfare are paramount. As a responsible Opposition party, the Congress will support any policy or programme that will advance these goals. The onus, however, lies on the government to win the cooperation of all opposition parties and all sections of the people to take the country on the road of peace and prosperity. Let me end this statement with the hope that the New Year will bless all of us with humility and wisdom even as we renew our pledge, as political parties, to serve the people of India to the best of our ability.

Officials associated with the move said public sector honey procuring and processing agencies including Kerala Khadi and Village Industries Board, Kerala Horticulture Corporation and the Forest Department will work for procuring honey from beekeepers and cultivators during the season.  They procure raw honey at the rate of Rs 130 per kg and processed honey at a price of Rs 315 per kg.  \"Kerala, first in the production and the treasure of honey in the country, is all set for honey season beginning from January to April,\" said M Muhammed Haris, Financial Advisor, Kerala Khadi and Village Industries Board.  Noting that Kerala honey has many peculiarities as its ingredients are collected from different type of flowers of various kinds of trees, he said the Kerala Forest Department sells forest honey at a price of Rs 385 per kg.  \"The bees collect honey from teak, rosewood, rubber, Arya vepu, cardamom and vaka. But in Himalayan regions bees procure honey from one type of tree, i.e. Surya Kanthi. The medicinal value of Kerala Honey is known to the country and abroad,\" Haris claimed.  He said the honey collected from Nilambur forests in Malappuram contains gold contents which is good for health of babies.  Haris said the beekeepers from Tamil Nadu also put bee boxes in Kerala especially in Idukki and Palakkad districts and earn lakhs of rupees from honey trade.  \"The farmers from Tamil Nadu put up boxes in coconut groves, rubber, cardamom, cashew, cocoa plantations and collect every five to six days. They will get 10 kg of honey from a box in six days,\" he said.  Haris said there is a lot of scope for beekeeping industry in the country and 300 per cent increase in honey production is not impossible if the government chalked out proper schemes.  \"The US, Canada and China are prominent in the production of honey. The agricultural production will also increase as the rearing of bees will help pollination and fertilization in plants.

Nepal is facing acute shortage of energy in the wake of the blockade of the Indo-Nepal border by Madhesis, largely of Indian-origin.

The import of additional power is expected to ease the current power outage facing the country.  Nepal currently produces around 780 MW electricity though the domestic demand stands at 1,300 MW during peak period.  Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli has during a function in Kathmandu said that the government is working towards ending the power outage within a year and for that solar power, among other alternatives would be explored.

PACL had raised Rs 49,100 crore from nearly 5 crore investors that it needs to refund along with promised returns, interest payout and other charges, which take the total amount due to more than Rs 55,000 crore, as per Sebis order. Besides, PACL has another group firm PGFL which has \"illegally mobilised more than Rs 5,000 crore and failed to refund the same in spite of directions of Sebi and SAT\", the regulator had said while initiating the recovery proceedings. The proceedings were initiated against PACL Ltd, as also its promoters and directors -- Tarlochan Singh, Sukhdev Singh, Gurmeet Singh, Subrata Bhattacharya, Nirmal Singh Bhangoo, Tyger Joginder, Gurnam Singh, Anand Gurwant Singh and Uppal Devinder Kumar. Sebi had asked them to refund the money in an order dated August 22, 2014. The defaulters were directed to wind up the schemes, and refund money to the investors within a period of three months from the date of the order.  Sebi also filed criminal complaints before Tis Hazari Court on November 17, 2015 against the company and its directors. The mobilisation of funds by PACL Ltd traces back to 1990s. Upon receipt of a complaint, Sebi had first issued letters in November-December 1999 to PACL, advising it to comply with the provisions of the Sebis CIS Regulations dealing with Collective Investment Schemes. PACL challenged the letters before the High Court of Rajasthan, claiming that its scheme does not fall under the definition of CIS. PACL had also challenged the constitutional validity of the CIS Regulations. The Court in its order dated November 28, 2003 held that PACLs schemes were not CIS as defined under Sebi rules and quashed Sebis directive to PACL. However, Sebi appealed before the Supreme Court, which in an order dated February 26, 2013 upheld the constitutional validity of CIS Regulations, and directed Sebi to investigate the matter and take appropriate actions. After conducting further inquiry, Sebi passed the order dated August 22, 2014, wherein, inter-alia, PACL, its promoters and directors were directed to wind up all the existing CIS of PACL Limited and refund the monies returns which are due to its investors. PACL had again approached SAT against Sebis order of August last year. The Tribunal however dismissed the appeal on August 12 this year and directed the defaulters to refund the money within a period of three months.

From a public health perspective, the green body said it would be misleading to underestimate the impact of vehicular pollution that occurs very close to our breathing zone.  It said that the IIT Kanpur study has shown that in winter, vehicles are the second largest emitters of PM2.5 after road dust, if both combustion sources and dust sources are considered. But it is the top emitters among the combustion sources in winter.  Moreover, in different parts of Delhi, diesel four- wheelers are the source of at least 60-70 per cent of PM2.5 in winter. Several other studies in Delhi have shown how real- time exposure on roads and close to roadside are several times higher than the background ambient levels, the green body said.

The flashpoint of the simmering tension between the IOA and the Sports Ministry was on the issue of the implementation of the tenure guidelines of the Sports Code, which has led to the government threatening de-recognition of the All India Tennis Association (AITA) and Judo Federation of India. The Sports Ministry had told the AITA and JFI that the election of Anil Khanna and Mukesh Kumar as chiefs of their respective federations were not valid as they did not serve a cooling period of four years before becoming Presidents. Khanna, also an IOA Treasurer, and Kumar served as secretaries for two consecutive terms before becoming presidents. Remaining defiant, the duo have said that the government has wrongly interpreted the tenure provision and the guidelines of mandatory colling-off period do not apply to a Secretary becoming a President. Mehta said from now onwards, the IOA will give bank accounts and other details of the participating athletes to the Sports Ministry so that the government could make the necessary arrangements. \"If Sports Ministry is taking advantage of something we do for the athletes from which we do not get any monetary benefit and they (ministry) are using it as a means to enforce the Sports Code to us, then we will henceforth give the bank accounts and other details of the athletes to them (ministry) so that they can make the arrangements,\" the IOA Secretary General said. Mehta said that many items in the circulars of the Sports Ministry about grants to the National Sports Federations were only meant for the training of the athletes and the NSFs themselves dont get any benefit. \"All over the world, it is a practice of governments to provide funds for the training of athletes and construction of infrastructure for hosting major international events. It is not that India is the only country doing like these. \"Here, the Sports Ministry is trying to force the NSFs to accept the Sports Code for giving them grants. It is not good.

Investigations into the murder of activists Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare were also challenged in the high court during the year while discharge of BJP President Amit Shah in the Sohrabuddin case and defamation case filed by RSS worker against Congress Vice President  Rahul Gandhi  grabbed headlines.  Among other petitions which stole the limelight in 2015 were Shiv Sena chief Balasaheb Thackerays will bequeathed to his family, the Bohra succession row, legal fight between the family of late actor  Rajesh Khanna  and his live-in partner Anita Advani, alleged corrupt practices by former Maharashtra minister Chhagan Bhujbal, controversy over Radhe Maas alleged involvement in dowry harassment case and Vodafones victory over Income Tax department in Bombay High Court.  The high court is currently hearing a bunch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the beef ban legislation in Maharashtra. In February 2015, the President had granted sanction to Maharashtra Animal Preservation (Amendment) Act. While the Act had banned slaughter of cows in 1976, the recent amendments prohibited slaughter of bulls and bullocks and possession and consumption of their meat.  Salman was convicted by a sessions court on May 6 after he was found guilty of ramming his car into a shop in suburban Bandra killing one person and injuring four others who were sleeping outside.  He filed an appeal in the high court which, on December 10, acquitted him saying prosecution had failed to prove that the actor was driving the car under the influence of liquor.  Another important case was the commencement of final hearing of confirmation of death sentence awarded to Baig, the lone convict in the 2010 Pune German Bakery blast case. A bench headed by Justice Naresh Patil, in August, also began hearing Baigs appeal against the death penalty given to him.  Baig, an alleged member of Indian Mujahideen, was arrested in September 2010 for his alleged involvement in the blast which killed 17 people and injured 58 others, including foreign nationals.  Four years after the scam-tainted Adarsh Housing Society filed a petition challenging the demolition order passed by the Union Ministry of Forest and Environment, the high court completed hearing arguments and reserved its order.  A division bench of justices R V More and R G Ketkar in September started final hearing in the petitions, including one filed by the society in 2011, challenging the demolition order and a petition filed by the Ministry of Defence seeking implementation of the demolition order.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said he was overwhelmed by the people's response to the vehicle rationing plan. \"Delhi has done it. By and large, Delhiites have taken this anti-pollution drive with open heart. Overwhelmed by the response of people we have received so far. I hope Delhi will show the way to the rest of the country,\" Kejriwal said. Kejriwal himself later told a TV channel that the measure culd curb pollution on a temporary basis and was not a permanent solution. Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi appealed to Delhiites to cooperate with the authorities so that the plan is implemented successfully. \"I appeal to people to cooperate with us for the coming 15 days,\" Bassi said. Though BJP MP and former Mumbai Police chief Satyapal Singh was stopped at India Gate today for travelling in even-numbered car, the MP's car was exempt as per the odd-even plan. \"We thank people of Delhi for making the scheme a success on the first day. The same Delhi, which was called selfish, has shown the way. We thank all people for choosing their children's health,\" Delhi's Transport Minister Gopal Rai said. Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi , the Union Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs, welcomed the initiative. But criticised the Delhi Government for making the scheme a political issue. Meanwhile, weather conditions added to the depression despite Delhi's stellar turnout. Officials of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) had said on Thursday that air quality in Delhi was expected to deteriorate over the next few days with a fall in minimum temperature and calm wind movement. Officials said the air quality remained \"very poor\" on Friday due to atmospheric conditions that did not allow pollutants to get dispersed. While a section of the ruling AAP attributed the sharp drop in PM 2.5 figures between early morning hours and afternoon to the car rationing experiment, scientists said pollutants usually touch their peak in the dawn and then gradually fall. SAFAR stations, located in various areas the city, displayed 'very poor' real-time Air Quality Index, which was in line with the forecast of the Union government body that was released on Friday. In no marked change from Friday, the average levels of PM 2.5 was around 180 microgrammes per cubic metre, three times above the safe limit of 60. The corresponding safe limit of PM 10 is 100. Central Pollution Control Board's real time AQI for the Punjabi Bagh, R K Puram, NSIT Dwarka and Anand Vihar stations were 'severe' at 5 PM. \"The boundary layer, beyond which pollutants cannot escape, comes near the earth's surface during the early morning hours resulting in the accumulation of pollutants. So the spike that was observed around 5.30 AM and the subsequent fall is understandable,\" SAFAR project director Gufran Beig said.

The demand for steel in the country is poised to grow as the market demand is positive due to government initiatives to invest in infrastructure, airport, road and its urbanisation plans like smart cities, Narendran added.  India has the capability to grow by 7 to 8 per cent, he said and expressed confidence that demand for more investments in infrastructure, airport, road and the governments urbanization plan would help grow the demand for steel.  However, the steel sector is in doldrums across the globe including China and the situation has come to such an extent that many companies in the sector across the world are unable to pay salaries to their employees, while most others are losing money.  Addressing a gathering on the occasion of New Year, Narendran said the prices of steel have come down to 2003 levels, but claimed that Tata Steel continued to perform well despite the conditions and has remained profitable.  \"Prices of steel are not in our hand. It is because of the commitment of our employees, who worked hard to achieve the target, that we have remained profitable but the situation has affected the margins of profit,\" he said.  Tata Steel has continued to produce at low cost like the Russian steel sector, which was at an advantage due to appreciation in their currency.  Besides India, the demand of steel is certain to grow in South East Asia, Mexico and Turkey, he said and advocated a level playing field to face the issue of dumping from countries with surplus capacity like China, Korea and Japan and compete with world players in the sector.  The government, Narendran said, had proposed a safeguard duty of 20 per cent to face dumping when prices of steel were USD 380.  However, it was reduced to USD 340 when approved and USD 260 when implemented, thus affecting profit margins.  Referring to the issue of level playing field, he said Tata Steel has invested Rs 40,000 crore, including in Kalinganagar project in Odisha, during the past few years and its management would certainly want support from the government to face challenges from world players.  \"We are not scared to compete with the world players,\" Narendran said and referred to dumping by China, which, he said, hindered generation of employment opportunities in the country.

Wishing Modi for the New Year, the 78-year-old anti-graft crusader in his three-page letter took a swipe at the prime minister, saying he may have forgotten the things which he promised during the 2014 Lok Sabha campaign like bringing back black money and building a corruption-free India. The letter was released to the press today. Reminding Modi of the need to implement the Lokpal and Lokayukta properly and fulfil other key poll promises, Hazare said that several letters written by him earlier on these subjects to the Prime Minister had been ignored.  \"I am writing again to remind you of these things. I am aware that several letters written by me to you have been dumped in the waste paper basket. This letter may also meet the same fate,\" Hazare said.  \"I dont expect a PM to respond to each and every letter written to him as it is not possible. However, there should be reply to the letter by a social activist who has dedicated his life to the nation,\" Hazare said.  In his latest letter, Hazare said the Modi government should implement the Lokpal and Lokayukta laws properly to curb corruption and also take steps to ensure that farmers got remunerative prices for their produce.  \"Corruption rose during the Congress-led regime earlier. Nobody could get work done in any office earlier without paying bribe. \"People trusted your words but even today no work gets done without paying money. Inflation has also not come down,\"  \"Promise of bringing back black money has also not been kept. You dont speak of implementation of the Lokpal and Lokayukta laws passed for curbing corruption. May be you have forgotten the things which you promised,\" Hazare said. Hazare also recalled that when he undertook the fast at Ramlila ground in Delhi it was not only the then Congress government but also BJP leaders  Sushma Swaraj  and  Arun Jaitley  had given an assurance in Parliament that the anti-corruption legislation will be passed.  \"When Narasimha Rao was the PM, he used to speak on phone sometimes. When (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee came to Pune he used to enquire (about me).  Manmohan Singh  against whom I wrote, used to reply to my letters.

Agnelo Gustavo Adolfo de Souza was born in Anjuna village of Goa, and the Church has already declared him Venerable in November, 1986.  He was a member of the Society of the Missionaries of St. Francis Xavier.  \"The room on the first floor of the seminary located at Rachol village, located about 8 km from Margao, was the last address of Fr. de Souza,\" he said.  \"In this room, lived de Souza as a spiritual father from 1918 till his death on November 20, 1927,\" reads a board put up outside the room.

There is speculation in political circles over the likelihood of JD(U), now a partner in ruling Congress-led UDF, returning to CPI-M led LDF.  The book releasing function also assumes significance that both the leaders shared a single platform after a gap a several years.  Kumar, then heading JD(S), had snapped ties with LDF and joined UDF following dispute over seat sharing in Parliament polls in 2009.  Later, he formed Socialist Janata Dal (SJD) and merged with JD(U) last year.  Echoing the sentiments of Vijayan for a joint fight against \"growing intolerance\" in the country under the BJP government, Kumar said there was a need for a united movement against these forces.  Kumar also warned that the nation would disintegrate if \"monolithic culture\" developed in the country and said Socialists would be always in the forefront to fight the challenges posed by these forces.  Kumar also suggested that some collaborative moves were necessary to fight communalism rising above Front politics.

The Competition Commission, in October, had received 21 filings seeking approval for mergers, the highest number for any month in the past four years.  Last month, CCI had announced that it has given decisions on 29 combination cases during December, highest ever during any given month.  CCI has the mandate to keep a tab on unfair business practices across sectors, while mergers and acquisitions beyond a certain threshold also require its approval.  So far, the commission has dealt with more than 300 cases related to mergers and acquisitions.  In a tweet today, CCI said it has \"received 127 combination cases in 2015 -- highest number of cases received so far in a calendar year\".  In July, CCI had revised its combination regulations as part of efforts to make the process simpler and more transparent.  According to the regulator, the amendments provide greater clarity and certainty with respect to Merger and Acquisition (M&A) filings and will help in avoiding undue delays in the approval process.  Among the combination decisions given this year are approval of IndusInd Banks acquisition of gem and jewellery portfolio of Royal Bank of Scotland, acquisition of 26.33 per cent share capital of Tata Projects by Tata Capital and Omega, and acquisition of iGate by Capgemini.  Also, merger of retail store and retail infrastructure businesses of Future Retail and Bharti Retail got CCIs approval alongwith acquisition of additional 23 per cent equity of Aviva Life Insurance Company by Aviva International Holdings.  Among others, Pfizer-Vidhi Research deal and acquisition of Piramal Enterprises lab diagnostics and point-of-care business by DiaSys India also got the regulators nod.  The regulator also gave its green signal to acquisition of wealth management business of RBS by Sanctum Wealth and the acquisition of animal health business of Novartis by Eli Lilly.  CCI also introduced electronic filing facility last month, making it simpler for entities to submit information related to mergers and acquisitions (M&A).  In August, CCI Chairman Ashok Chawla had said that there was at least 15-20 per cent increase in filings. M&A filings for this year are likely to be 20 per cent more than the previous year, he had said.  CCI Member Augustine Peter had also said in November that there has been an increasing trend in combination filings in the recent past, which indicates that investors are increasingly turning positive about the Indian economy.

In 2014-15, engineering exports had aggregated over USD 70 billion.  Engineering exports, which account for about 23 per cent of the countrys total merchandise exports, dropped 14.4 per cent to USD 39.85 billion during April?November from USD 46.55 billion during the same period last year.  \"There is no question of engineering sector reaching the last years level of USD 70 billion in FY16.

Primary iron and steel, along with all non-ferrous metals and products, which contribute the maximum to the engineering export basket, saw a real bloodbath in the export market, leaving absolutely no pricing power with the producers, he said.  The primary iron and steel exports have fallen by more than 28 per cent in November 2015 against the corresponding month in 2014, while the fall has been over 40 per cent for the products segment.  For the April-November period, the aggregate drop in these two areas has been over 25 per cent.  \"All non ferrous metals and products, barring tin and products made of tin, witnessed deterioration in exports during November 2015.

The polls to the civic body in Hyderabad assume significance in view of the size and demographic profile of the city.  There are as many as 24 Assembly constituencies under the GHMC limits with a population of about 65 lakh. There have been allegations that the number of voters exceeded the population in GHMC.  The GHMC polls, likely to be held in the coming few weeks, are a litmus test for the ruling TRS as the party has not been known to be a major force in the city.  TRS did not contest the last GHMC elections in 2009 and is keen to win the coming elections to prove its complete domination in Telangana.  A majority of assembly segments under GHMC limits have been won by the opposition TDP-BJP nominees though some of the TDP MLAs switched loyalty to the TRS.  The TRS had kicked off its campaign for the poll much ahead of its rivals with a number of hoardings on the governments achievements installed at different locations in the city.  The TRS government had also announced property tax exemption for certain sections and other decisions like regularisation of contract staff and fresh recruitment in government departments.  In an informal chat with mediapersons, Telangana IT and Panchayat Raj Minister K T Rama Rao, son of Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, today said the TRS government has put the city firmly on the path of making it a world-class city.  Amid opposition allegations that TRS had earlier intimated the Seemandhra natives in the city, Rama Rao had earlier sought to reach out to them, saying that no unwanted incident against them has taken place since the formation of Telangana.

The Delhi governments ambitious Odd-Even scheme, to allow odd or even numbered vehicles on alternate days, got off to a decent start on New Year with volume of cars on the city roads coming down significantly amid deployment of thousands of policemen and moderately augmented public transport.

As per initial observations of System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the gains of less vehicular emissions could have been more had there been less vehicular movement and no bursting of firecrackers on the night of January 31.  Although the average value of suspended particulate matter PM 2.5 rose to around 198 micrograms per cubic metre, an increase as compared to yesterday, a fall could be observed between 8 AM when the odd-even scheme kicked in and 2 PM, SAFARs Project Director Gufran Beig said.  \"Air quality remained very poor.

However, the jump that was seen afterward need to be examined scientifically and it was possibly due to a sudden dip in the day time temperature. Cooler temperature heightens pollution.  \"It is still premature to conclude anything with just 10 hours available for comparison,\" he said in a statement.  (SAFAR) had yesterday said that air quality in Delhi was expected to deteriorate over the next few days with a possible rise in the level of particulate matter due to fall in minimum temperature and calm wind movement.  Officials said the air quality remained \"very poor\" today due to atmospheric conditions that did not allow pollutants to get dispersed.  While a section of the ruling AAP attributed the sharp drop in PM 2.5 figures between early morning hours and afternoon to the car rationing experiment, scientists said pollutants usually touch their peak in the dawn and then gradually fall.  SAFAR stations, located in various areas the city, displayed very poor real-time Air Quality Index, which was in line with the forecast of the Union government body that was released yesterday.  In no marked change from yesterday, the average levels of PM 2.5 was around 180 microgrammes per cubic metre, three times above the safe limit of 60. The corresponding safe limit of PM 10 is 100.

Sorafenib, a drug that inhibits the growth of new blood vessels, remains the only available therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a common type of liver cancer, researchers said.  Thus, a novel approach against HCC is essential for a better therapeutic outcome, they said.  Researchers from the United Arab Emirates University examined the chemopreventive action of saffrons main biomolecule, crocin, against chemically-induced liver cancer in rats, and to explore the mechanisms by which crocin employs its anti-tumour effects.  \"We investigated the anti-cancer effect of crocin on an experimental carcinogenesis model of liver cancer by studying the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferation, pro-apoptotic activities of crocin in vivo,\" the researchers said.  \"In addition, we provided a network analysis of differentially expressed genes in tissues of animals pre-treated with crocin in comparison to induced-HCC animals tissues,\" they said.  To further support the results, in vitro analysis was carried out.  The researchers assessed the effects of crocin on HepG2 cells - a perpetual cell line consisting of human liver carcinoma cells - by treating them with various concentrations of crocin. In addition, they studied the effects of crocin on cell cycle distribution of HepG2 cells.  The researchers demonstrated the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties of crocin when administrated in induced-HCC model.  Crocin exhibited anti-inflammatory properties where a protein complex NF-kB, among other inflammatory markers, was inhibited.

The technique - which leverages polymer chemistry and UV light in some novel ways - could find use in high-temperature settings at scales ranging from microelectromechanical devices to jet engines, researchers said.  Three-dimensional printing of ceramics holds some big potential advantages, owing to its ability to create complex shapes that are difficult to create using conventional methods.  The most common additive-manufacturing techniques for ceramics, involving layer-by-layer, selective curing of powder-based precursors, have been painfully slow, and have created products with unacceptably high porosity and a tendency towards strength-reducing cracks.  Looking for a better, faster approach, researchers at the HRL Laboratories in California built on previous developments in two areas: ceramic polymer chemistry and the details of UV light control in the additive-manufacturing process.  The researchers tweaked the chemistry of inorganic preceramic monomers, which have been used for decades to synthesise ceramic fibres and similar materials, to make the monomers build into polymer chains when exposed to UV light.  Next, they experimented with several approaches to spatial control of additive manufacturing using a resin of these UV-curable preceramic monomers.  In one particularly interesting technique, the monomer additives were selected so that they not only facilitate polymerisation, but create a change in the index of refraction of the resin as it polymerises - such that the UV light is internally reflected and concentrated within the ceramic polymer as it is built.  In essence, the growing ceramic chain becomes a waveguide that facilitates and controls further polymerisation by collimated UV light at the tip.  A final pyrolysis step at the end, which involves heating the printed polymer to 1,000 degrees Celsius in inert argon gas, drives off any remaining volatiles, leaving behind a pure ceramic part.  The result of the process is flexible, strong 3D printed components consisting of cross-linked ceramic networks.  Electron microscopy confirmed that the ceramic material contains little or no porosity and cracking.  Other tests suggest that the material can withstand temperatures of some 1,400 degrees Celsius without degradation and shows mechanical strength \"10 times as high as commercially available ceramic foams of similar density.\" PTI SAR SAR", "section": "Education", "topics": {"LAW, COURTS, TRIBUNAL": 0.02857142857142857, "HEALTH AND LIVING": 0.14285714285714285, "TRENDING ISSUES": 0.05714285714285714, "EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTES, ENTREPRENEURSHIPS, RESEARCH": 0.6857142857142857}, "day": 1}

Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken chose not to comment on the issue saying that it is \"too early\" to speak about the scheme as it is only the first day of the 15-day implementation, which also includes an extended weekend, in the national capital.

Simiao Fernandes, a priest in the Rachol seminary, told PTI.  Fr. Agnelo Gustavo Adolfo de Souza was born in Anjuna village of Goa, and the Church has already declared him Venerable in November, 1986.  He was a member of the Society of the Missionaries of St. Francis Xavier.  \"The room on the first floor of the seminary located at Rachol village, located about 8 km from Margao, was the last address of Fr. de Souza,\" he said.  \"In this room, lived de Souza as a spiritual father from 1918 till his death on November 20, 1927,\" reads a board put up outside the room.

Raminder Singh Ranger, chairman of Sun Mark Ltd, was yesterday awarded the Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE).  Popularly known as Rami Ranger in London circles, the businessman has won the Queens Enterprise awards for five consecutive years in the past.  He authored From Nothing to Everything, which charts his rags to riches story from his birth in Gujranwala, in modern day Pakistan, before his family made the journey to India during Partition.  Beginning with a dramatic flight from home during the turmoil of partition of India in 1947, the journey takes in the assassination of his father, childhood hardship under the guiding hand of his mother, emigration to England and the long fight against prejudice to achieve success on a scale he could hardly have imagined as a naive young immigrant in London in 1971, the book description reads.  Having founded his first enterprise with just 2 pounds and a typewriter in 1987, Rami Ranger now oversees Sun Mark and sister firm Sea Air and Land Forwarding Ltd, a 160-million- pound-a-year FMCG operation.  \"My story shows that one does not need a rich father, an elite education or the old schoolboy network to help one in life. What one needs is self-respect, ethics, commitment and empathy for others,\" Ranger says in the book.  Ranger is also chairman of the British-Sikh Association and patron of Princes Charles charity, Princes Trust, and the Gandhi Statue Memorial Trust, formed to raise funds for the Mahatma Gandhi statue at Parliament Square unveiled last year.

Shah took charge as BJP president in July last year after the incumbent   Rajnath Singh  joined the Modi government as home minister. While the tenure of BJP chief is fixed at three years, Shah's current term will end in January this year as he was nominated party president only for the rest of Singh's term.   As per the party's rules, the election process for its president's post can be started only after the completion of organisational elections in at least half of the state units. As on Thursday only three states \u2014 Rajasthan, J&K and   Uttarakhand  \u2014had completed the election of their state unit chiefs. The party members said 15 more states need to complete their processes to pave the way for the president's poll process.   \"Going by the reports from various state units where organisational elections are in various stages, the requisite number of states will complete their process before January 10. The election of the party's national president can start any time after that.\"   Given the fact that assembly elections are slated in   Assam , Bengal and Kerala early next year, the BJP leadership has already nominated new state presidents in these states to lead the party during the elections.   The organisational elections will therefore be considered only after elections. In case of   Bihar , where the party was busy in assembly polls, the organisational polls are likely to be delayed beyond the election of president. The members said while the organisational election in UP was in advanced stages, the state unit has yet not formally intimated its timeframe for election of state unit chief.    Many states to complete process soon:     BJP-ruled   Madhya Pradesh ,   Chhattisgarh  and Goa are likely to complete their processes in the next few days, while several other smaller states in north India as well as in the northeast have indicated that they will complete their organisational elections to meet the requisite number of states required for election to the party's national president.

The survey covered 5,480 companies across 12 industry sectors in 21 major cities. The latest TimesJobs.com Job Outlook 2016 survey of over 1,614 employers across India also shows positive hiring plans by nearly 60 per cent of the surveyed organisations. The survey covered over 1,614 employers across India. \"With the government's Digital India and Make in India push, manpower demand is bound to increase in core technology and manufacturing sectors in 2016,\" TimesJobs.com COO Vivek Madhukar said. The e-commerce and startups will add a significant number of jobs this year, he added. On salary front, HR experts forecast handsome pay hikes and the hikes could be much higher for the top talent. The Seventh Pay Commission recommendations, which call for a hefty hike in salaries of the government employees, are also expected to have a ripple effect in the private sector. \"In year 2016, average raise of the salary will go around 12-14 per cent wherein the key performers salary hike can hit as good as 25-30 per cent,\" executive search firm GlobalHunt's Managing Director Sunil Goel said. According to Naukri.com Chief Sales Officer V Suresh, \"2016 will be a year to cheer for job-seekers across sectors. Our Naukri Hiring Outlook also predicts IT/ITES and BFSI to sustain the momentum gained in the coming year as well.\" Echoing similar sentiment, staffing firm Teamlease Managing Director Ashok Reddy said \"We are expecting a 10-12 per cent increase in hiring in 2016 as favourable growth forecast coupled with renewed faith in the ongoing reforms and fast clipped consumer spending is expected to boost the employment scenario\".

The quarterly Manpower Employment Outlook Survey puts India as the most optimistic among 42 countries in terms of hiring plans for the first three months of 2016. \"In the white-collar space, 2015 saw a huge impetus from highly funded start-ups with the largest ones ramping from a few hundred to a few thousand people. If the funding continues in 2016, we will see more jobs being created there,\" said Harpreet Singh Grover, CEO & Founder of CoCubes Technologies, an assessment platform. Experts believe that initiatives like 'Make in India' can entail significant job creation in the manufacturing, automation sectors in the coming year. The plan to create 100 smart cities is expected to fuel the job growth further. \"As major expansions are poised to materialise by next September, hiring will become more proactive, especially before the appraisals in March 2016,\" Satya D Sinha, CEO of executive search firm MANCER Consulting said. According to Spectrum Talent Management's Co-Founder Vidur Gupta, the significant rise in job numbers in 2016 would be largely owing to couple of new horizons opened through technology in engineering/ITeS/Pharma/E-Commerce. Other promising areas include bio-science which is going to create a slew of vacancies in the coming year, said Rajesh Tripathi VP and Head of HR at GHCL. Rituparna Chakraborty, President of Indian Staffing Federation, said the IT sector is likely to create around 2.7 lakh jobs, while nearly 1.5 lakh jobs can come in e-commerce.

Largely influenced by   US monetary policy  and dollar flows, the price of gold fell 10 per cent in 2015 as some investors sold the   precious metal  to buy assets that pay a yield, such as equities.   The most-active US gold futures for February delivery settled at $1,060.2 per ounce on Thursday, almost flat compared with Wednesday's close of $1,059.8 and close to six-year lows of $1,046 per ounce earlier in December.   Spot gold was down 0.2 per cent at $1,061.4 an ounce at 1:57 p.m. EDT (1857 GMT), during the last trading session of the year. Volumes were thin ahead of the New Year holiday on Friday.   \"The key factor for gold remains the strong dollar and that ultimately trumps all other issues including the economy and the geopolitics,\" said Ross Norman, chief executive of bullion broker Sharps Pixley.   The dollar was on track for a 9 per cent gain this year against a basket of major currencies, making dollar-denominated gold more expensive for holders of other currencies.   Other precious metals have also been hit by dollar strength and the gold slump, and were headed for sharp annual declines.   The most-active US silver futures settled at $13.803 per ounce on Thursday, down 0.3 per cent from Wednesday and ending the year down 12 per cent. Spot prices were down 0.2 per cent at $13.83 an ounce.   Industrial metals platinum and palladium were harder hit, notching up big yearly losses partly due to oversupply from mines and concerns about growth in demand.   Platinum futures settled at $893.2 per ounce, down 26 per cent from a year ago, while the most-active palladium futures ended at $562, down 30 per cent on the year.   Following the US Federal Reserve's first interest rate rise in nearly a decade earlier this month and indications the central bank would resort to gradual increases in 2016, the outlook for gold does not look bullish.   \"2016 will start very much more of the same, which is to say, ongoing Western paper selling, ongoing Eastern physical buying,\" Sharps Pixley's Norman said.   Other fundamentals were not supportive either. Assets of SPDR Gold Trust, the top gold-backed exchange-traded fund, were near a seven-year low while short positions on COMEX gold contracts were close to a record high.   A bearish outlook for oil could also pile pressure on gold. Gold is often seen as a hedge against oil-led inflation.   \"My concern is that   gold prices  could remain in the $1,000-$1,200 an ounce range for a prolonged period of time as the drivers continue to be the same, including global monetary policies and euro/dollar strength,\" Commerzbank managing director Adrien Biondi said.

India will meet defending champions Afghanistan in what will be a replay of 2013 edition in Kathmandu. In the second semi-final, Afghanistan hammered Sri Lanka 5-0 to make it a repeat of the 2013 edition in Kathmandu.  Mohammad Hashemi (45'+), Kanischka Taher (50th min), Khaibar Amani (56th min), Ahmad Arash Hatifi (78th min), Faysal Shayesteh (89th min) were the scorers for the defending champions.  In the India match, once again showing his scoring abilities after an impressive Indian Super League (ISL), Jeje found the net in the 34th and 66th minute after skipper Sunil Chhetri put the hosts ahead with a nod in the 25th minute at the Trivandrum International Stadium.  Ahmed Nashi (45'+2') and Amdaan Ali (75) were on target for Maldives in a match that was marked by wonderful attacking play and poor defending.  Seeking a record 7th SAFF title, India were on the game from the word go as Chhetri played one to Arnab Mondal whose left-footed shot deflected off Jeje's feet on its way into the back of the net. However, the 24-year-old Chennaiyin FC striker was ruled off-side.  In the 22nd minute, Holicharan Narzary's flick off a Eugeneson Lyngdoh corner was cleared just in time by the Maldives' defence.  India soon broke the deadlock when the country's all-time leading scorer Chhetri cashed in on a Narzary cross from the right and headed in the ball past the Maldives goalkeeper mran. Before that Lyngdoh's shot was kept out by the custodian.  There was another chance for India, but Imran kept out Jeje's attempt before finally giving in when Narzary played one over the Maldives defence to Jeje, who slotted it in past the hapless goalkeeper to make it 2-0 for the home side coached by Stephen Constantine.  160th ranked Maldives looked desperate for a goal and Ahmed Nashid delivered the goods for the visiting side when he made use of a pass from Imaaz, who received the ball from Ali Ashfaq.  Almost certain to improve on their current FIFA ranking of 166 after this win, India were celebrating again as Jeje made it 3-1. Chhetri played one for Jeje inside the box and the Mizo lad dribbled past Amdaan Ali and then Shafiu Ahmed before placing the ball to the goalkeeper's right.  With a cushion of two goals, Constantine decided to call back Chhetri and brought in the highly promising Chhangte Lallianzuala in the 74th minute. A minute later, Maldives gave themselves hope with a strike through Ali Amdaan, who headed in a corner after outjumping Arnab Mondal.  Even as Maldives desperately tried to look for an equaliser, India, who attacked with flair, held onto the lead to emerge triumphant after two brilliant assists from Narzary.

Given the sluggish trends in the real estate market and continued fall in gold prices, the mutual fund industry also expect to begin attracting a larger share of the Indian households' savings from this year.  Mutual funds invested almost USD 11 billion (Rs 70,716 crore) in domestic equities in 2015, more than 2.5-times of about USD 4 billion infused last year, as per the latest data.  Retail money flew into equities through mutual funds route supported the benchmark indices at a time when the foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) went on a selling spree.  FPIs were net buyers of equities to the tune of just USD 3.2 billion in 2015. Before that, they had invested USD 20 billion each in stock markets in the preceding three years.  \"We look forward to a similar scenario like this year's where FPIs invested USD 3 billion in 2015, whereas domestic mutual funds have seen strong inflows. This means that while FPIs are considerably important, it is the domestic inflows that are here to stay for the long term that will fuel growth,\" Quantum AMC CEO Jimmy Patel said.  The industry players feel that the outlook remains bullish for the New Year in terms of equity markets.  \"Considering softer commodity prices, muted real estate market and flattish debt market scenario in 2016, the outlook for equity in 2016 continues to remain encouraging. While the current years inflow number may not be matched, the inflows nevertheless are likely to remain positive,\" Jayesh Shroff, Fund Manager (Equities) at SBI Mutual Fund said.  However, LIC Nomura Mutual Fund Chief Investment Officer (Equity and Debt) Saravana Kumar said: \"Maintaining the same momentum (in terms of inflows) may be a challenge if 2016 turns out to be as volatile as the past year.\"  The fund houses also saw a growing interest from retail investors, indicating an emerging shift in their investment preferences from physical assets to financial assets.  The inflows from retail category were close to Rs 1.7 lakh crore in 2015, a major upswing compared to Rs 1.3 lakh crore seen in the entire 2014.  \"Retail participation has shown remarkable resilience to market volatility and we are confident that it will continue in 2016,\" Reliance Mutual Fund CEO Sundeep Sikka said.  Patel said that retail participation could provide the much needed liquidity to the stock markets that have been largely driven by FPIs for the past few years.  Just 10 million people of the 1.2 billion plus population of India are estimated to be mutual fund investors.  \"Equities are likely to emerge as one of the best performing asset classes over the long run and investor are expected to prefer the asset class on higher growth potential coupled with relatively lower attractiveness of alternative investment options,\" he said.  Besides, equity-oriented mutual funds would remain preferred vehicle for equity market exposure.

The DB while upholding Rule 111 of the Police Rules observed that Prosecuting Officers are part of the Police Department. \u201cThe plea of the State Government that Police Rule 111 is applicable to Prosecuting Officers and entire Police Force is upheld\u201d, the DB said.Since the seniority of Prosecuting Officers was altered without issuing notice to the aggrieved persons in 2008, the DB said, \u201cthe non-issuance of notice to the writ petitioners whose seniority was finally determined after calling for objections with regard to the provisional seniority list after giving temporary promotion to some of them that too after several years on the facts and circumstances of these cases have vitiated the orders of re-fixing the seniority\u201d.\u201cThe writ appeals are disposed of and the order of the Single Judge is affirmed insofar as allowing the writ petitions and quashing the re-fixation of seniority is concerned\u201d, the DB said.", "section": "Crime, Law and Order", "topics": {"LAW, COURTS, TRIBUNAL": 0.5555555555555556, "CRIME": 0.05555555555555555}, "day": 1}

TRAI, which on Wednesday extended the deadline for submission of comments till January 7 amid an intensified campaign for and against Free Basics, said a large percentage of the record number of 18.27 lakh responses have been only about supporting the specific Facebook product without answering the larger issue of 'differential pricing' concerning Net Neutrality.  Free Basics, which Facebook is promoting with double-page newspaper advertisements for days as also through TV, billboards and online forums, is being seen in many quarters as being against the basic principles of Net Neutrality.  TRAI, which has already ordered Free Basics to be put on hold in India, is now likely to finalise views on the issue of Net Neutrality by January-end.  The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) Chairman R S Sharma said that a record 18.27 lakh responses have been received so far, of which a large percentage are about supporting a specific product called Free Basics.  Indicating that the whole consultation process could have been hijacked, Sharma said: \"It is like we have asked Question X and they have given answer to the Question Y.\"\u00a0  He said the authority has received 8.9 lakh responses supporting Free Basics where the respondents have just given their mobile number whereas 5.44 lakh comments are received through Facebook mail.  \"... so about 14.34 lakh are such comments. Now the problem for this is that we had asked for response to the specific question of differential pricing... instead we have got responses on supporting Free Basics. Now how supporting Free Basics help in answering the questions... it has become difficult for us to arrive at,\" Sharma said.  He further said one approach that could have been taken is to just ignore these responses but as people have taken time out to respond, therefore ignoring the comments is not fair.  \"... that was one of the reasons why we extended the deadline because we thought just ignoring this will not be appropriate because this is the record number of responses which we have got,\" he said.  Sharma said the authority has decided that those places where they have the email ids of these template responses, Trai will respond back to them asking to answer the questions raised in the paper along with their justifications.  He, however, did not elaborate if the people did not reply to Trai, the comments on Free Basics would be termed invalid.  \"Consultation by Trai are not opinion polls, we are not asking if the answer is yes or no because that does not help us. We are asking why you think it is yes or no because that helps us in formulating the policy or guidelines. To all those whom we can approach, we will try to reach them,\" Sharma said.

Australia's biggest city, Sydney, traditionally the first to host a major event to ring in the New Year, welcomed 2016 with spectacular midnight fireworks as crowds thronged to harbourside vantage points.  Pyrotechnics burst over the city in a colourful display which was expected to draw more than one million people, ahead of the chimes of midnight moving across Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Europe and finally the Americas.  In the heart of Europe, annual festivities and fireworks in Brussels have been cancelled as the Belgian capital -- home to NATO and the European Union -- remains on high alert.  \"It's better not to take any risks,\" mayor Yvan Mayeur said.  Belgian officials are battling terror on two fronts -- with police today detaining six more people over an alleged New Year attack plot in Brussels as well as arresting a tenth suspect over last month's jihadist massacre in Paris.  Officials said two men had already been formally charged with terrorism-related offences and that police detained six more people Thursday for questioning over an alleged plot to strike \"emblematic sites\" in the Belgian capital during the end-of-year festivities.  Paris, still reeling from the November 13 slaughter of 130 people, has also cancelled its fireworks display.  But authorities agreed France's biggest public gathering since the attacks can go ahead on the Champs Elysees avenue, with bolstered security.  \"The people of Paris and France need this symbolic passage into the New Year,\" said Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo.  \"After what our city has lived through, we have to send a signal to the world,\" she told the weekly Journal du Dimanche.  Hong Kong, Beijing, Singapore and other Asian cities may rival Sydney's pyrotechnic splash, but Brunei will offer a sober evening after banning Christmas in a shift to hardline Islamic law.  Jakarta remains on high alert after anti-terror police foiled detailed plans for an alleged New Year suicide attack in the Indonesian capital.  Turkish police have detained two Islamic State suspects allegedly planning to stage attacks in the centre of the capital Ankara, expected to be packed on New Year's Eve.

While the Modi government\u2019s diplomatic moves appear to have soothed the turbulence in relations on India\u2019s west, its ties with close northern neighbour Nepal need urgent mending.  With the Madhesi agitation on the border, which Nepal maintains is backed by India, still continuing, the shortage in supply of essentials is likely to add a bitter tinge to the creeping winter in the friendly relations.  Nepal is one of India\u2019s closest neighbours, sharing ties of culture and tradition, and marriage links across the border. It is the only country with which India has visa-free and passport-free travel. Thousands of Nepalese live and work in India and many Indians have settled down in Nepal, set up businesses there. The \u201cRoti Beti\u201d links are an accepted facet of the relations.  Highlighting the new strain in ties, Nepalese Prime Minister KP Oli has chosen to visit China on his first overseas trip after taking over, in a break from tradition. Most Nepalese prime ministers visit India on their first state visit. The other exception was Pushpa Kamal Dahal \u2018Prachanda\u2019, Nepal\u2019s 33rd prime minister and chairman of the Maoist party, who visited Beijing instead of New Delhi in 2008.  Modi conveyed to Oli, during a telephonic call by the latter on Thursday, the \u201cimportance of finding a durable solution to the political problems facing Nepal based on consensus or \u2018sahmati\u2019.  Oli\u2019s decision to visit China looks aimed at rankling India. The Nepalese prime minister has not shied from making anti-India statements. Beijing, while it will obviously welcome the decision of the Nepalese prime minister to visit China, would not be willing to upset India.  India-China relations are going smoothly, despite the border hiccups. Besides, Beijing would be keen to prevent the Tibetan uprising from billowing, and for that keeping its southern border with Nepal impervious is necessary. Closer ties with Nepal would mean opening up the border outposts that got buried after the Nepal earthquake. Beijing is not keen to reopen the posts yet.  India\u2019s new policy on Nepal -- of not bending backwards to please \u2013 apparently has the blessings of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office.\u00a0  The talk in the diplomatic corridors is that India has always gone overboard to help Nepal in every way, and been taken for granted. \u00a0India is keen that Nepal heeds the Madhesi demands, of greater representation and inclusiveness. Otherwise the discontent in the Terai could spillover in the form of violence into India\u2019s northern border.  Perhaps the Modi government could use the expertise and goodwill of those political leaders who have used their good offices in the past with Nepal to bring about rapprochement.  Just like the new Pakistan policy, where the Lahore visit has helped sow the promise of warmth and dialogue, maybe the Modi government could do something similar out-of-the-box.", "section": "Finance", "topics": {"EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION, EDUCATIONAL ISSUES": 0.09090909090909091, "HEALTH AND LIVING": 0.2727272727272727, "ECONOMIC GROWTH": 0.36363636363636365, "TRENDING ISSUES": 0.09090909090909091}, "day": 1}

As much is apparent from foreign minister Fumio Kishida admitting the Japanese government\u2019s \u201cresponsibility for recruiting comfort women with the involvement of the army and for severely injuring the honour and dignity of women\u201d. It has been a historic moment of candour for the dispensation in Tokyo, verily a moral victory for women. Many of the victims of the era of \u201ccomfort women\u201d may no longer be around; those who are must now be in their eighties and nineties. Yet that ought not to detract from the significance of Tuesday\u2019s agreement, which is essentially a compromise on the part of Abe. The Japanese government will provide $ 8.3 million (1 billion yen) to a foundation that the South Korean government will put in place to \u201cheal the wounds\u201d that women suffered during the inter-war years.  The striking feature of the rehabilitation package is that it will be funded directly from Japan\u2019s national budget -a remarkable compromise not least because the previous Asian Women\u2019s Fund was dependent on private donors and was never accepted by the government in Seoul. For all that, some among the 46 surviving women do have a point when they cavil that the deal stops short of Japan accepting what they call \u201clegal responsibility\u201d for recruiting \u201ccomfort women\u201d and setting up \u201ccomfort stations on the frontline\u201d, where the victims were \u201ctreated as sub-human slaves for Japanese soldiers\u201d. Nonetheless, the agreement does signify a new phase in bilateral relations, not least the resolve not to criticise each other over the issue at the United Nations. The world must hope that the curtain has come down on an ugly phase of history.\u00a0", "section": "Events", "topics": {"METRO AND DEVELOPMENT": 0.25, "PUBLIC EVENTS, CELEBRATIONS, AWARDS, FESTIVAL": 0.125}, "day": 1}

For HAL\u2019s getting the nod from the Russian manufacturer of the Kamov 226 helicopter as its joint-venture partner in India runs counter to expectations that in order to widen the production base, and to give \u201cmake in India\u201d (in the defence sector) an enlarged dimension, a private player would be \u201cpushed\u201d. The tie-up announced a couple of days back would surely thwart the ambitions of the Anil Ambani group that is in the process of establishing a major production facility in Nagpur. The experience of Russian industry when working with HAL for the indigenous production of MiG and Sukhoi fighters is said to have weighed in the PSU\u2019s favour; so also that its \u201cDhruv\u201d series of helicopters use a Turbomeca engine, the Kamov uses another version of the French power-pack. The Prime Minister is scheduled to launch HAL\u2019s new helicopter-building unit in Tumkur a couple of days hence: it had been planned for Dhruvs, now there is speculation that a Kamov production-line could also be set up there.  While in normal course the HAL-Kamov tie-up would have been roundly welcomed in domestic aviation circles, there are reservations over the public sector monopoly in helicopter production remaining unbroken. For while HAL is putting on a \u201cshow\u201d during its anniversary celebrations, its functioning still reflects the shortcomings of a state-owned monopoly. Cost and time overruns, inadequate quality control, accountability-deficit etc have created deep divisions between HAL and the Indian Air Force. It is no secret that the India-built MiG-21 fighters, HS-748 and Dornier 228 transports have not performed as well as the \u201coriginals\u201d. The IAF had successfully pressed for a private player to partner Airbus Industry in building a replacement for the HS-748 \u201cAvros\u201d. A similar arrangement had been desired for the Kamov -competition from a commercial rival could prove the spark HAL needs to elevate its functioning. Some experts feel that HAL has too much on its hands to \u201cdeliver\u201d, and many of its initiatives have flopped -the development of an intermediate jet trainer being one of them.  The Russians do not have a reputation for \u201ccommercial efficiency\u201d, so doubts linger whether the acute shortage of military helicopters will be addressed expeditiously. Yet given the potential for huge orders (200 in the first phase), an \u201cadventurous\u201d avenue could be explored for having the Russian principal to also come to an arrangement with a private player. The order book and prospects for exports could sustain two production units, inject the requisite competitive drive, dismantle a creaking monopoly, as well as give private industry an \u201copening\u201d.", "section": "", "topics": {}, "day": 1}

The year ended with the possibility of Brexit, when the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, finally submitted his wish-list for renegotiating the British-EU relationship. This was the sequel to a dramatic speech that David Cameron gave in 2013 when he promised that if the Conservative Party retained power in the next general election, he would try to extract far-reaching concessions from the EU, and based on the outcome would ask the British people in a referendum to decide on the continued membership in the EU before the end of 2017. Now that he retained power in the general election this year, he had to act.  Cameron basically had four demands: 1) EU should be more competitive and pursue more trade deals; 2) a bigger role for national parliaments and a recognition that Britain was not bound by ever closer union; 3) a guarantee that euro-zone members would not discriminate against non-members; and 4) denying EU citizens migrating to Britain social benefits until after four years of their residency there. He was quite flexible at first and asked only for the changes to be \u201clegally binding\u201d and \u201cirreversible\u201d, without insisting on a new treaty. He was very courteous, met all the 27 other EU heads of government and key officials in Brussels. He realised that all EU partners were against Brexit and was emboldened enough to ask for parliaments of all EU members to ratify the treaty. The polite diplomacy undertaken so far became quite hostile and the deal that Cameron wanted to seal in the December 17-18 end-of-the-year summit of the EU heads of government suddenly got tangled in controversy and recrimination.  Cameron is in a hurry. Already the initial wide lead of the \u2018yes\u2019 camp is getting narrower, with one poll just before the summit predicting a neck-and-neck race. If this trend continues, the outcome of the referendum in favour of a Brexit cannot be ruled out. Any decent outcome of the negotiations would help Cameron to announce the referendum by the end of summer. Even more interesting is the attitude of the English people about the EU. Scotland is expected to vote overwhelmingly in favour of remaining within the EU. In fact, continued membership in the EU is their main strength if they decide to secede from the United Kingdom in future. This means that only a minority of English voters already want to get out of the EU, even though England has always been a major player in European history. This is because the English want traditionally to stand on a chair with three legs.  Right after the Second World War, British foreign policy was guided by the famous three-circle theory formulated by Winston Churchill earlier. In this scheme England was placed at the intersection of three circles. One circle contained only one other member, the United States of America, because of their \u201cspecial relationship\u201d. The other two circles contained the British Commonwealth and Continental Europe, respectively. With the incomprehensible decision of Jawaharlal Nehru to join the new Commonwealth after our Independence, this three-circle scheme of Churchill could be implemented in the new post-War world order.  In 1952 six contiguous countries in Europe, France, West Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, formed the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). Not surprisingly, England declined the invitation to join the club. When this Community was deepened and made into the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957, England again refused to join. However, by 1960 the advantages of the EEC membership were becoming apparent. Faster growth within the EEC relative to Britain forced some rethinking in the English business community. Soon thereafter Britain applied for membership to the EEC. In a historical veto, Charles De Gaulle denied British entry to the EEC in 1963. The document explaining the French \u00a0non \u00a0is still a fascinating one to understand fundamental differences between England and Continental Europe. Here is one representative paragraph: \u201c(England) is maritime, she is linked through her exchanges, her markets, her supply lines to the most diverse and often the most distant countries; she pursues essentially industrial and commercial activities, and only slight agricultural ones. The means by which the people of Great Britain are fed and which are in fact the importations of foodstuffs bought cheaply in the two Americas and in the former dominions, at the same time giving, granting considerable subsidies to English farmers? These means are obviously incompatible with the system, which the Six have established quite naturally for themselves.\u201d There were also other subtle factors. De Gaulle believed, perhaps rightly, that England would act as the US Trojan Horse within the community. Furthermore, he might have thought that the inclusion of Britain in the Community would hinder his ambition to be the natural leader of Europe.  After one more rejection by France in 1967, Britain finally was admitted to the EEC in 1975. Negotiations started in earnest only after De Gaulle died, and the entry was preceded by a positive vote in a referendum by the British voters in favour of Britain joining the Community. However, a large number of nay voters never accepted this decision. The issue also had no ideological underpinnings. Both major political parties, the Conservatives and Labour, were equally divided on the issue. The only consistent advocates in favour of the membership were members of the small Liberal party. British entry into the EU (then EEC) was a purely economic necessity. It signified England\u2019s abandoning any pretence of being an independent world power. Their anti-European feeling is evident in the role they played within the EU during the last forty years. They have been a constant irritant in all EU decision-making processes, which reached its peak during the Thatcher era. The most dramatic was the demand for \u00a0\u2018rebate\u2019 \u00a0that Thatcher forced her European partners to agree to by threatening to get out of the EEC. Britain did not join the Euro, but continued demanding a place in decision-making meetings on the currency. They blackmailed other EU countries into agreeing to various unilateral opt-out clauses for Britain in the Maastricht and Lisbon treaties. They routinely hold up EU budget meetings to get the maximum concessions possible. This led some exasperated European leaders to whisper about a two-tier Europe, with a core group and the rest on the periphery. To accommodate the British demand, the European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, openly suggested this option recently to avoid an eventual Brexit.  The year-end summit agenda was dominated by the refugee crisis and an attempt to secure the entire border of the European Union. Cameron promised his countrymen that he would negotiate as vigorously as Thatcher did in 1984. He forced his colleagues to listen to his impassioned speech for forty minutes. At the end the main sticking point remained unresolved. The British proposals are now going to be negotiated in the next summit in the middle of February. The most difficult one that still remains is the British demand to discriminate against EU citizens migrating to the United Kingdom regarding their rights to benefit from the social welfare benefits of the new country of residence. This is never going to be granted, particularly by countries of East Europe. There may be some fudging over the issue, but whether the British public would buy that in making their voting decisions is far from clear. One of the latest post-summit opinion polls reported in the London newspaper, The Telegraph, is even more dramatic, with 47 per cent for a Brexit and only 38 per cent for Britain to stay in the European Union!

Manjula in Materi village (Mau block) would be hoping that her husband and his brother who went away as migrant workers can somehow get their long-denied wages and return. She would also be praying for their recovery from serious undiagnosed illnesses.  In Kalchiha village, Ramjiyai would be looking at her five grand children sleeping half-hungry and wondering how long will be able to feed and clothe them on the small amount she earns as a mid-day meal cook. Their father toils in distant places that keep changing, while their mother died recently at a young age.  Kamlesh would be remembering his small, sick child he carried in his lap as he left his village in Banda district with his wife in search for work in distant areas. The child died half way into the bus journey.  In Oram village Shyama would try not to look at the tree in her courtyard from which her father (farmer turned migrant worker Munna Lal) hanged himself. She would be hoping that at least one of the several officials who promised help at the time of the tragedy would keep his word.  Munni Devi of the same village would be thinking why she allowed her son Anshu to work in the village\u2019s fire cracker factory. She knew this to be very hazardous yet when hunger in the family became unbearable she had to agree to Anshu\u2019s working there. There was an explosion and her son, the symbol of her hopes, was burnt to death. For her it is hard to find any hope in the new year so it is all the more important to try and bring at least a single ray of light into her dark world.  It is in places like these that our country has something to take pride in as despite all adversities, there are numerous examples also of dedicated work with the weakest sections and with distressed people. To give just a few examples, in remote villages of Chattisgarh doctors of the Jan Swasthya Sahyog travel regularly to very remote villages overcoming many hardships so that victims of TB, leprosy and cancer can get badly needed treatment.  Activists of Aman Biradari reach out to victims of communal violence to share and reduce their problems and isolation. Neglected children of schools in remote villages of Rajasthan find that their problems are now being heeded due to a campaign for improving government schools. Even in distant America, non-resident Indians get together to pool resources for reaching out to activists working with the genuinely needy sections of society.  Such efforts, in India and other parts of the world, have helped to keep alive our hopes, yet we have to also face the bitter truth that human folly has led to accentuation of serious problems. In many countries like Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya and Yemen, international interventions made in the name of democracy and other highly desirable objectives have actually worsened the situation, leading to more violence and death and displacement of several hundred thousand people.  Entirely avoidable conflicts are increasing at a time when there is greater need for peace and stability so that the most pressing survival issues like climate change and mass extinction of species can be resolved before it is too late. Time is running out fast, but instead of mobilizing the truly great efforts needed for the most important tasks, the 21st century world is still embroiled in conflicts relating to religion and race. While the most cruel manifestation of this is in the form of activities of ISIS and its affiliates, many other conflicts based on social discrimination and hatred also exist in many parts of the world.  At the root of the many conflicts is a strong urge for dominance and greed, which is all-too-evident even in international conferences and negotiations where it becomes increasingly clear that the richest and the most dominant have no intention of giving up their privileges and luxuries \u00a0for a larger cause. For them, only those solutions for the earth\u2019s most pressing problems are acceptable which do not challenge their privileged position. But such narrow solutions cannot bring real change, and so cannot obtain the much needed people\u2019s participation. So while rhetoric rules, the most serious problems continue to pile up.  Where then is hope for 2016? It may not be very visible, but it nevertheless has a very significant presence in the millions of every day actions of ordinary people that rise above self-interest to help others in many small ways. Hope exists also in the thousands of sane voices that are raised almost every day for workable solutions to world\u2019s problems.  How do we ensure that these millions of selfless small actions of people become the components of a well thought out and comprehensive effort to solve the world\u2019s most pressing problems? How do we ensure that these thousands of sane voices can be brought together to create the framework of such a comprehensive plan?  It can be done. It is difficult but possible. And in such efforts lives the hope of the new year.

For this reason, it is nearly always wedding season at their house. The workday does not begin until sometime in the afternoon and it does not end until deep into the night \u2014 after the guests have left the brightly lit venues, and the chairs and tables and lights and stages have been dismantled, to be set up again the next day for the next wedding.  Over the years, their wedding business has grown to gargantuan proportions with attention being given to the most microscopic of details. It is not a surprising development; as Pakistan\u2019s cities have swelled with newer arrivals and the progeny of old inhabitants have grown to adulthood, betrothals are numerous and more resplendent.  There is, however, another reason for the ever-expanding numbers of businesses catering to the soon-to-wed. As the rate of rural to urban migration rises, and the expanding labour export market leaves many in a constant revolving process of arrival and departure, the family structures that sustained the marital celebration have all but disappeared.  The consequence, of course, is that weddings (and not simply the matches made) are transactional affairs.  It is far easier to pay someone to make the food, provide the music and set the stage; indeed, with money one can guarantee mirth and merriment of a sort that family relations never could. Those that are paid to be joyous and accommodating, after all, are much more reliable than the relations scarred by deceptions past, by inheritances denied \u2014 all the dark realities that those hosting weddings are eager to forget.  And forget they do, thanks in part to those that have made weddings a business. With the once-loved ones duly sidelined, wedding organisers and planners will happily take over, ensure that the mehndi is arranged in glittering trays, the offerings for the bride, the perfume and the bangles, the shoes and the chocolate, are all arrayed on trays and wrapped up in tulle. Whatever gaps are left unfilled by the paid can be made up by friends enlisted over the years, whose weddings the now bride and groom have dutifully attended: the cashing in of favours past. If the now marrying have been lackadaisical in attending the mehndis, mayuns, nikahs and rukhsatis of others, the effects will be visible, usually on the dance floor. As all urban Pakistanis know, the number of dances to the latest Bollywood numbers, remixed rap anthems and revitalised oldies are all testaments to the popularity of the bride and groom.  The sweaty, dancing, hapless souls, happy on demand and desperate for a bit of the limelight, must participate in the mandatory merriment; it may be their best chance to snag a wife or husband of their own. A second rank may constitute the recently married, eager to exhibit the dribbles of youth that marital drudgery has not bled away, exhibiting the triumph of still fitting into the garments of one\u2019s glory day.  Nearly everyone who reads this article will participate in such a spectacle in the short cool months, when large crowds are more easily amassed, fatty foods more easily consumed. Old saris will be dragged out per the retro themes of the day, itchy suits and over-garnished sherwanis stuck over bodies grown large between now and last December.  If the hirelings that have been employed to produce the wedding feast are well paid and honest, there will be biryani and korma and only mild heartburn. If not, the vapid consumption of grease-laden food will end with a long night, solitary payment for communal gluttony. Those are the physical risks, the psychological carnage of forgotten sisters, ignored cousins and so much else that has a cost all its own \u2014 that accrues invisibly but inflicts its own mortal wounds, whose blood and gore lie just beneath the enforced joy.  The wedding is an emblem of culture, and the Pakistani culture, battered by decades of war and demographic change, stands changed. The Pakistani wedding, with its hollow adherence to custom and tradition, largely aped from television dramas and Bollywood sagas, is an attempt to patch up the holes and gaps of now with hired hands and self-serving friends. Underneath the mandatory merriment lies a torn social fabric that is not what it used to be and has little idea of what it wants to be.  A sincere commitment to maintaining familial relations requires more than attendance at weddings; it necessitates respect and a desire for love to mean more than the public proffering of hugs and kisses at nikahs and rukhsatis.  If the increasing numbers of monetary transactions involved in arranging a wedding, from the florist to the DJ, from the caterer to the venue manager, are any evidence, then it is money and not family that is of primary importance. With the former, the pretence of a happy family untainted by sibling cruelties and parental favouritism can be magically recreated at the wedding venue: a glittering bride and groom, a backlit stage, thumping music, all making up for the love and closeness that is no more.  The big wedding has long been a South Asian boast, and urban Pakistanis have begun to enact its grandiosity and faux sentimentality with the artifice of Bollywood productions. There are actors and actresses, some better than others; there are set designers and scriptwriters, choreography and music and, of course, heroes and villains.  There is one crucial difference though: the unreality of the Bollywood production is well known but the chicanery of the urban Pakistani wedding, its glittery gloss over frayed families, its garish re-enactment of cinematic scenes, insists that it is, in fact, the real, joyful, thing.

Diplomatic efforts will get momentum with the meeting to revive the dialogue process between the Afghan government and the Taliban.  Pakistan earlier brokered the first ever face-to-face talks in early July and the second round was cancelled after the death of the Taliban leader Mullah Omar was revealed in late July.  All stakeholders are now making efforts to end the deadlock in the process that was necessary to stop the Taliban's Spring Offensive. The Taliban launch the annual offensive in late March or early April.  Asif told the senate the quadrilateral meeting will clearly demarcate responsibilities of each stakeholder at all stages.  Talking about the Army Chief General Raheel Sharif's recent visit to Kabul, he said the army chief carried a message to Kabul that the peace process would necessarily be Afghan-led and Afghan-owned.  \"It was agreed that they will pursue peace and reconciliation with Taliban groups willing to join the process,\" the minister informed the upper house of the parliament.

In a letter to his defence minister Rouhani said on Thursday reports that the US Treasury planned to blacklist companies and individuals with ties to Iran's ballistic missile programme constituted \"hostile and illegal interventions\" that justified a response.  His comments came as relations worsened after US defence officials said an Iranian vessel had test-fired several rockets near three Western warships, including the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier, in the strategic Strait of Hormuz.  Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards, who are responsible for protecting Iranian interests in the Strait and regularly patrol and conduct exercises in the area where much of the world's oil passes, denied its ships were involved.  Spokesman General Ramezan Sharif accused the US of fabricating the alleged December 26 incident as part of a \"psychological operation\".  \"The Guards' naval force had no exercise in the past week when the Americans claim that a missile or rocket was fired in the Hormuz Strait area,\" he said.  Though the rockets were not fired toward any warship, their proximity to them and several commercial vessels - reportedly around 1,500 yards (metres) - was \"highly provocative\", said a US official.  A French frigate and the USS Bulkeley destroyer were also in the area at the time.  Responding to the threat of new sanctions, Rouhani, under whom Iran negotiated the nuclear deal with the US and five other world powers, warned of reprisals.  Should individuals and companies be added to \"the previously unjustified sanctions list, it is necessary that the production of various missiles required by the armed forces move forward with increased speed and seriousness,\" Rouhani wrote to Defence Minister Hossein Dehghan.  The president's comments were also posted on his official Twitter account.  In the five months since the nuclear deal was struck, US officials say Iran has conducted two ballistic missile tests, one of which state media reported at the time, on October 11.  Iran also recently aired television footage of an underground missile base.  A United Nations panel found earlier this month that the missile tests breached previous UN resolutions aimed at stopping Iran from developing missiles capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.  Tehran has always denied seeking an atomic weapon.  The nuclear deal was heralded by moderates such as Rouhani, who staked his reputation on the negotiations, but hardliners in Tehran said it damaged Iran's national interests.\u00a0 ", "section": "International", "topics": {"INTERNATIONAL NEWS": 0.6666666666666666, "TRENDING ISSUES": 0.2222222222222222}, "day": 1}

Terming the development as a \"New Year gift\" for the people of the state, Tuki urged the department to ensure that the fund is utilised judiciously and on time.  A tourist complex at Nafra, rafting and angling centers in Seppa and craft bazaar with amphitheatre at Ziro would be developed under the project.

This fiscal,(remaining three months) the government targets to get an additional Rs 70 crore from the revised tax. The rates match that of neighbouring states, he said.\u00a0  The GST is likely to be introduced very soon and the tax rates would be around 15 to 16 per cent under the GST. Keeping this in view the centre has enhanced rate of service tax from 12.36 per cent to 14.5 per cent. Taking cue from this, some states have increased tax rate up to 15 per cent, he said.\u00a0  He referred to 15 per cent tax in Gujarat and 14.5 per cent tax in West Bengal, AP, Telangana. The cabinet approved of a 10 per cent hike from 25 to 35 per cent on foreign liquor as a measure to dissuade people from liquor consumption.\u00a0  With regards to petrol and diesel, the state cabinet took note of the fact that there is a loss of revenue (VAT and Entry tax) of about Rs 417 crore per annum due to fall in prices of petrol and diesel.\u00a0  Since prices of petrol and diesel are changing frequently, the state is losing revenue and therefore a policy decision was taken to increase VAT rate on petrol and diesel.

The practices adopted in the view of accumulation of mass by the colonial rulers converted the peasants to bonded labourers once they failed to pay exorbitant taxes. This highhandedness of the British rule had also greatly impacted India\u2019s indigenous systems of water management and harvesting.  Nevertheless, the local communities, particularly the peasantry, could have still sustained the age-old irrigation systems had they not been deprived of their financial resources by the new land revenue system of the British.  On this matter, the nationalist economic historian, Ramesh Chandra Dutt wrote, The dominions of the last Mahratta Peshwa passed under the British rule in 1817; and from that year the land revenue was continuously raised.  In 1817 the revenue realised from the newly acquired territory was 80 lakh, in 1818 it was raised to 115 lakh and in a few years more it came up to 150 lakh ... The village community system completely broke down under this pressure, the Raiyatwari system, introduced by Sir Thomas Munro, suggested the introduction of a similar Raiyatwari system in Bombay, ie, a system of separate settlements and individual cultivation.  On land settling operations in the Deccan and Gujarat, Romesh Dutt states further, Every effort was made lawful or unlawful to get the utmost out of wretched peasantry, who were subjected to torture, in some instances cruel and revolting, beyond description if they could not or would not yield what was demanded.  Numbers abandoned their homes and fled into neighbouring states; large tracts of land were thrown out of cultivation, and in some districts no more than a third of the cultured area remained in occupation.  On the whole, agricultural efficiency was grossly under decline during the British rule due to over exploitation. The land revenue was fixed at 50 per cent of the produce, but in some parts of India under British rule till 1855 or so, the proportion of land revenue to be paid to the government was even slightly higher, which clearly draws a picture of the extent of exploitation of the peasantry.  For example, in Madras Presidency in Raiyatwari areas, cultivation of around one-third of the irrigated area had been suspended, because land revenue in such areas exceeded the value of the gross produce.  The general condition of peasantry has not improved till now, though exploiters are not government but the middle men, local money lenders, bankers, and finally bureaucracy. The attitude of the bankers is purely commercial, because when it comes to lending money to the farmers, banks simply ignore the government guidelines.  The upkeep of traditional water resources was carried out by the local community, but with the decline of this dispensation, the colonial rulers found it highly difficult to manage them, because they were scattered over a large area.  Even the locally appointed zamindars could not be induced to carry out such repairs. Whichever area came under the rule of the British, sooner or later the village communities of that area were broken up.  This practice actually started during the Mughal rule, when the power of the village headman was seized and handed over to the bureaucratic agent of the emperor, and the job of tax collection was also handed over to the local agent of the emperor called a zamindar.  However, when the Mughal administration was strong, the village communities did not break up, but with the disintegration of the Mughal Empire, the welfare of the village communities was also neglected. With the degeneration of the local communities traditional water structures and irrigation systems also gradually eroded.  Once the zamindars also played a key role in maintaining peace and order as an agent of the king. To quote Romesh Chandra Dutt; \u0085zamindars have not only been de facto landlords, but also de facto rulers within their own estates since the dawn of history.  They performed the same necessary and useful part in the history of Bengal, previous to the British rule, that the Barons of Europe performed or were supposed to perform, in the Middle Ages.  They preserved peace and order within their own estates, repressed crime and punished offenders, adjudicated cases and protected labourers and cultivators and represented and maintained the royal authority and influence.  The Permanent Settlement of 1793 of Lord Cornwallis perpetually fixed the revenue demand, which led to an upsurge in sub-infeudation, a hierarchy of revenue collecting rights was created, which led to extreme extortion of peasants. The result was disastrous for the local water bodies, lakes and ponds shrunk, channels were choked, tanks silted up and existing wetlands were overrun by farms.  All this mismanagement manifested in the form of Madras famine in 1877, and Lord Lytton was left with no option than to think of creating new resources for famine relief and insurance.  New taxes were introduced and a sum of Rs.1.5 lakh was fixed as famine grant, and an assurance was given to the Indian subjects that proceeds obtained from taxes would not be expended for any other purpose other than for which it was imposed.  But a pledge is always made to be broken, and the same fate awaited this pledge also, and very soon it was broken. The grant which was incorporated in the budget of 1878-79 was suspended in the budget of 1879-80.  In 15 years down, the earmarked famine relief fund amounted to Rs 22 crore, whereas actual fund sanctioned was only Rs 17.6 crore. It is also to be admitted that agencies of the British were always sincere in projecting the real picture, in this connection, the report of the Finance Commission of 1898 is worthy to be noted, With the best of intentions, British administration in India have repeatedly drifted into errors or forgotten their pledges because people themselves have been debarred from any real share in the administration.  In fact, the minor irrigation works were highly beneficial, though the British did not spend any money on their construction or repair. The total area irrigated through traditional minor irrigation systems was 7.44 lakh acres of land.  It is high time Indian government learnt the utility of traditional irrigation systems and conducted research to make them effective once again to save the country from the scourge of skewed and spatial rainfall pattern due to global warming.  Let our MPs individually adopt a particular rural area of their respective constituencies as a test case under Local Area Development scheme, and lo within a couple of years they will themselves note the effectiveness of renovated water bodies for the purpose of irrigation.  The government also must learn from the past experiences, construction of big dams or contemplating similar water shed projects are of no avail, because in the long run they will simply prove futile exercises due to heavy siltation and annual change in the rainfall pattern.  Under British, private irrigated areas constituted around 50 per cent of the total irrigated area in the country, which comprised largely tanks, wells, canals and small channels linked with streams or rivers, especially barricaded by inexpensive earthen dams.  The private irrigated area was quite extensive around 1.5 million hectares. However, this figure excluded the normally flooded areas, where floodwaters of the rains were withheld each year for a couple of months for irrigation erecting temporary embankments.  Still it is not too late; the government can encourage the local panchayats to construct such temporary embankments under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employee Guarantee Scheme annually to provide water for irrigation.  The Irrigation Commission in its report of 1901-03 stated that despite release of grants and loans for repair, construction and improvement of such water sources and providing technical knowhow for designing sluices, outlets and identifying such old sites of water bodies, zamindars never displayed any interest.  However, the government grants earmarked annually for extending irrigation facilities to farmers for railway lines development. The British government attached more importance to the development of railways than irrigation for the reason was mainly political.  The British government wanted to facilitate easy movement of army within the country. Even the British committed greatest blunder with the progress of its rule, when it gradually shifted its emphasis from traditional irrigation works such as tanks, wells, embankments and small river channels to canals having large command areas.  The objective of the British for giving emphasis on large irrigation works was to facilitate promotion of cultivation of export crops; they were least bothered whether local food production was enough to sustain India\u2019s population.  Between 1920 and 1940, for instance, in the United Provinces and Madras, practically there was no increase in the area of private irrigation, rather the area shrank, and on the contrary government sponsored canal irrigation scheme recorded a rise of 83.71% and 11.7% in Uttar Pradesh and Madras respectively.  However, situation was different in the states not ruled by the British, for example, in old Hyderabad state the area irrigated by tanks increased up to the first half of the 20th century. The figure of tank irrigated area has gone up from 4500 hectares in 1895-96 to around 3.64 lakh hectares some forty years later.  Coochbehar is another example; the whole district of Cooochbehar was a land of dighis or artificially dug tanks. Therefore, the intensity and nature of irrigation in different areas entirely depended on the influence exerted by the local governments.  After independence gradually the traditional water harvesting structures have been rendered into disuse. Though billlions of rupees have been spent under MGNREGA for earth cutting, those old water bodies continuously remain neglected and disused. For example, in Jodhpur alone, more than 200 old water bodies are in a state of decline and decay.  Though canals are still flooded with water during rains, most of them are in a broken state and silted and many feeder tanks are in a state of utter neglect and disrepair. Many old baolis (tanks), called sagars locally, have been converted into dumping grounds by the civic authorities and locals..  However, times are changing. Today people are gradually becoming aware of the environmental crisis, but the main hurdle is our archaic system of laws and governance.  The British had drafted laws keeping in view their own colonial interests; though the new Constitution of India has been drafted, yet most of the laws governing India\u2019s land, water and forests management were formulated by the British.  Moreover, Indian government contemplates to deal with environmental and other problems in the 21st century with the archaic 19th century laws and bureaucracy, though in terms of environmental laws, there has been some sporadic changes, which is at least can be dubbed as a good beginning.  The burning question is: will the Indian government continue to manage the rural setting with gilded bureaucracies, who always suffer from superiority complex and try to maintain a palpable distance between them and the general public, or relegate its management into the hands of rural communities? Further, every old laws devised by the British to ease their governance in India, needs to be rewritten, to suit the Indian setting.

Half a decade on, Singapore has grown into an Asian business and financial hub, but the the country's economy of late is showing signs of stress.  A slowdown in China, which is the biggest destination for Singapore's non-oil domestic exports, and sluggish global demand have weighed on Singapore's manufacturing sector and economic growth this year.  \"Yes, we have many more opportunities in the globalised world, but we also face fierce competition. Yes, we have more resources, but we also have higher aspirations. Our economy is slowing down and undergoing transition. We cannot expect an easy journey ahead,\" he stressed.  Lee also recapped his September election victory saying, \"as the results came in, I felt gratified and happy that voters had delivered a big win for Singapore.\"  \"We were united in our desire to secure our shared future, to achieve the best for Singapore. It encapsulated what the election was about our people and our future.\"  Lee's ruling People's Action Party (PAP), founded by his father and founding Prime Minister, the late Lee Kuan Yew, scored a landslide in the General Elections.  PAP has ruled Singapore since independence and led well before that in pre-independence assemblies.  The premier also recalled the emotional farewell given to his father, who died in March this year.  \"Singaporeans lined the streets to bid him a final farewell (on March 29). The rain was pouring. As the gun carriage left Parliament House, people shouted his name.  \"I was deeply moved to see everyone's faces drenched, grieving, but not downcast. We were one people, grateful for what our pioneers had achieved, resolved to take Singapore further forward.\"  The elder Lee is respected for having built Singapore's living standards from \"third world to first world\" and is respected globally including India for developing an island into an Asian business hub.", "section": "Events", "topics": {"MINISTRY AND DEPARTMENTS, MINISTERS": 0.3, "INTERNATIONAL SPORTS": 0.2, "PUBLIC EVENTS, CELEBRATIONS, AWARDS, FESTIVAL": 0.3}, "day": 1}

In India, several institutes are researching newer therapies based on empirical study and experiments of the effects of stem cells in different biological realms. The job of a stem cell research scientist is to carry forward this study. It is not only medical professionals who can be eligible for a career in stem cell research and therapy. Students of basic biology can also find jobs in stem cell research and related fields.  What are the educational requirements to become a stem cell scientist?  Students need a postgraduate degree in regenerative medicine or in science and knowledge of biology. At this point, the highest scope of entry into the stem cell research industry is for students. Although a comprehensive medical academic background is not an essential requirement for entry into this field, having an understanding of the working style and concept of research is an added advantage to those who wish to contribute.  Are only medical professionals eligible for a career in stem cell research and therapy?\u00a0  The answer is no. Students of basic biology too can find jobs in stem cell research and therapy. Stem cell research is among the most rapidly growing fields of science in India as several institutes are researching newer therapies. Even the Central government through its agencies such as the DBT, DST, and ICMR, has started investing funds to support basic and transnational research in this field of science.  Could you name a few institutes where one can apply? Also, how good is the infrastructure when it comes to the career prospect?  There are a few institutes like the Centre for Stem Cell Research, a unit of the Institute of Stem Cell Research and Regenerative Medicine (inStem) in Bangalore. Another one is the School of Regenerative Medicine Manipal University, which is one of the country\u2019s first stem cell training institute and was established in 2007. One can also look at the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, which is again in Bangalore.  How prospective are career opportunities for a stem cell research scientist?  The current investment in stem cell research in India is more than Rs 1,000 crore. Most of the investment in stem cell research in India is in the government sector. So there are a lot of research opportunities on a national front in this country.\u00a0  What is the salary that can be expected by a stem cell research scientist?

The event which involved non-stop chanting of mantras on all days besides devotional programmes, including bhajans and 'harikatha' (recital of religious stories), was attended by several dignitaries and spiritual leaders.  The stated objective of the ceremony was to promote universal peace and people's welfare.  Tamil Nadu Governor K Rosaiah, his Maharashtra counterpart C Vidyasagar Rao, Union Ministers M Venkaiah Naidu and Bandaru Dattatreya, NCP President Sharad Pawar, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu were among the prominent personalities who visited the Yagam.", "section": "Government", "topics": {"MINISTRY AND DEPARTMENTS, MINISTERS": 0.6, "INTERNATIONAL SPORTS": 0.1, "BUSINESS AND COMPANIES": 0.1}, "day": 1}

There were changes in some organisations, rebellions and allegations of corruption that rocked the polity. The Opposition in Parliament was unyielding and key legislations were derailed. The Narendra Modi government appeared to be on the back foot.  With several states going to polls in 2016, and the Opposition looking formidable, what lies ahead?  thestatesman.com  takes a look at the political parties in the New Year.  \u00a0Will lotus shine bright?  In 2015, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had a tough time as it lost in key elections in Delhi and Bihar. It was not really what party\u2019s national president Amit Shah expected: The high-decibel campaigning led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was supposed to ensure BJP\u2019s victory. While that didn\u2019t happen, the party is now gearing up for the next round of state elections in 2016.  However, the party organisation is not strong in most of these states -- West Bengal, Kerala and Assam being the prime examples. Moreover, the Narendra Modi government must deliver on the promises of good governance. So far, the Modi government has failed to bring about any effective change in the social and economic sectors. Unless the Modi government manages to put governance back on track, living up to its promises of \u201cache din\u201d and drive that message to the people, it won\u2019t be an easy ride in 2016 as well.  The BJP top brass will also have to deal with the domination of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as well as rein in the motormouth leaders who keep making controversial statements that have not gone down well with the people in general.  The Modi government will also have to try to get key legislations passed --- the Goods and Services Tax Bill being the most important reform bill among them. Which means the government will have to get the Opposition (read the Congress) on board. It remains to be seen whether the Grand Old Party plays the role of a constructive opposition or continues with its obstructionist ways.  A rejuvenated RaGa, but not enough  After the massive rout in the Lok Sabha elections of 2014, the Congress was looking forward to 2015, hoping that things will look up for them. The year began on a bleak note: The party was routed in Delhi Assembly election. But the results of the Bihar Assembly election later in the year came as a relief, with the party winning 27 seats of the 41 it contested. And more importantly, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi found his voice. His relentless attacks on the Modi government, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ensured that the country took notice. With just 44 MPs in Lok Sabha, Rahul and party president Sonia Gandhi gave the NDA government a hard time. \u00a0Key bills were blocked, derailing the Modi government\u2019s much-vaunted reforms agenda.  Amid all this it is expected that a rejuvenated Rahul Gandhi will take over the reins of the party from her mother in 2016. But will that be enough? The Congress is facing state elections, crucially in Assam and Kerala where it is the ruling party. The Congress won\u2019t like to suffer a defeat ala Delhi, though there\u2019s huge anti-incumbency against the governments in both the states. The party will also have to deal with the National Herald case in which Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have been named as the accused. So, despite its high-pitched opposition in Parliament, the Congress will have to work much harder to win back the trust of the people. And that\u2019s not easy.  Socialists cannot rock the Janata boat  In Bihar, the two old rivals -- Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad Yadav -- came together to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party. Both Nitish and Lalu formed an alliance that was unthinkable even a few years ago. With the added support of the Congress, the Mahagathbandhan of Janata Dal-United, Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress won handsomely in the state Assembly election in 2015, defeating the saffron alliance under the BJP.  But the one party which drew blank was the Samajwadi Party which broke ranks with Nitish and Lalu. Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav didn\u2019t pay heed to the bait of becoming the chief of a grand Janata Parivar --- the union of all the Janata parties. But with the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election slated in 2017, the Samajwadi Party may have to do a rethink on its strategy. It remains to be seen whether it chooses the path of merger with other Janata parties, a strategic alliance with secular outfits or prefers to be on its own.  So far as Nitish and Lalu are concerned, they have to do a balancing act in Bihar. There could friction, especially on the law-and-order front in Bihar: there are already murmurs of return of the \u201cjungle raj\u201d. \u00a0Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will have to ensure that his government and the state or the party don\u2019t suffer due to any such negative perception. And for Lalu, it is more important to keep the boat sailing smoothly because, as he said after the Bihar polls, his next target is Delhi.  Wary Amma may stay put  Acquitted from the disproportionate assets case, AIADMK supremo and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa is going strong. Her bonhomie with the BJP top brass is seen as a sign that things are fine between the state government and the Centre, something that may help her in the long run. However, the floods in the last half of 2015 were a setback for her; It dented her image quite badly. There have been allegations that she has been a chief minister who remained absent from the public view. It\u2019s worrisome for sure for the Amma.  In this backdrop Jayalalithaa faces Assembly election in 2016. She has to battle all negative campaigning in the run-up to the elections and one of her ways would be to ensure that the flood reliefs reach the affected people. So far she has sanctioned hundreds of crores of rupees on this count which is being given to the victims through direct money transfer. She just has to deliver on governance, and that will ensure that she returns to power as is widely expected.  Didi breathing easy, may sail smooth  In West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was in deep trouble as her ministers and MPs got arrested in the Saradha chit fund scam in 2015. With more skeletons tumbling out of the closet, life looked extremely difficult for the Trinamool Congress supremo. Relations with the Centre were bitter over Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) actions in the scam. Mamata accused the Narendra Modi government at the Centre of vendetta. In that backdrop her relation with trusted lieutenant Mukul Roy also deteriorated. \u00a0  However, things are looking bright as of now. Relations with the Centre and Roy have improved. It seems that despite the growing proximity between the Left and the Congress in the state, Mamata is all set to return to power in 2016 when she faces the Assembly election. Anti-incumbency factor may not just work against her despite BJP\u2019s best efforts. She could sail smooth.  CPI-M banking on flexibility \u00a0  For the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M), 2014 was a year for change. Sitaram Yechury became the party\u2019s new general secretary. He\u2019s not a hardliner like his predecessor Prakash Karat. And under the new skipper, CPI-M has decided to have \u201cflexible tactics\u201d to deal with the evolving political scene in the country.  The party continues to impact national politics even though it is not strong anymore in its one-time stronghold West Bengal.\u00a0  However, both in West Bengal and Kerala -- the two states that are slated to go to polls in 2016 -- CPI-M is hoping that it will fare better than it did the last time. But, the fact is in Bengal there\u2019s no strong leader in the party unit to steer the outfit. In Kerala there are those rebel elements that may dash the party\u2019s hopes of resurgence.  2017 calculations on Behenji\u2019s mind  The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) under Mayawati is keeping a low profile. True that it won around 700 zila panchayat wards after the Lok Sabha elections. However, in 2015, it fielded 237 candidates in the Bihar Assembly election but failed to win even a single seat.  So the party is now focusing on the larger picture. It is trying to consolidate the Dalit-Muslim vote bank ahead of the 2017 Assembly election in Uttar Pradesh. The party is also expected to counter the RSS machinations to appropriate the legacy of BR Ambedkar. \u00a0  Aspirations of Aam Aadmi  After ascending to power in Delhi in 2015, Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is going strong. However, the party is constantly battling the Union government, accusing it of interference in the affairs of the Delhi government. The constant war between the Centre and the Delhi government has got murky with Kejriwal alleging \u201cvendetta\u201d after the Central Bureau of Investigation raids on the Delhi Secretariat.  In 2016, the party will try to strengthen itself in terms of governance and organisation, keeping the municipal polls in mind. But it has to battle the perception that there is no internal democracy in AAP as was alleged by senior party functionaries who were later expelled.  Away from all that the party\u2019s focus will be on the Punjab Assembly election. The party is hoping that it will be able to win the hearts and minds of voters there; Arvind Kejriwal is all set to launch the party\u2019s campaigning in Punjab on January 14 with a mega rally at Muktsar. \u00a0", "section": "Political", "topics": {"POLITICAL PARTY, POLITICAL LEADER": 0.6, "HEALTH AND LIVING": 0.2}, "day": 1}

German authorities were tipped off by a \"friendly intelligence service\" about the plan, which IS had planned to carry out around midnight, said Joachim Herrmann, interior minister for the southern state of Bavaria.  \"Five to seven\" suspects were believed to be planning to carry out a \"suicide attack\" as festivities were under way to welcome in the New Year, Munich police chief Hubertus Andrae said.  Police evacuated Munich's main rail station and another station in the western suburb of Pasing after an alert of a possible \"terror attack\".  Rail services at the sites were also halted and police urged the public to keep away from large gatherings.  Some 550 officers had been deployed to track down the suspects and secure the sites, although no arrests have been made yet.  Police officers, some in riot gear, were posted at different entrances of Munich's main rail station which was eerily quiet on a night of traditionally raucous celebrations.  Some revellers sought to enter the station but were turned away.  A police spokeswoman said it could not be ruled out that the attackers could seek another target.  German media had earlier reported that police were acting on a tip from French authorities.

These developments cap the tenure of Asoke Kumar Mukerji, who is retiring as India's Permanent Representative. He had waged a constant battle to get the Council to properly consult with troop-contributing countries as it issues and monitors peacekeeping mandates.  The Council recognised that the consultation process involving it, the troop contributors and the UN Secretariat \"do not meet their expectations and have yet to reach their full potential,\" US Permanent Representative Samantha Power, the Council President for December, said in a statement released Thursday.  \"The Security Council stresses the importance of substantive, representative and meaningful exchanges and underscores the importance of full participation by the three stakeholders so that meetings are useful and productive,\" Power said.  In June in one of several speeches at UN debates, on peacekeeping, Mukerji had crticised the Council saying it was \"enforcing the will of a small privileged minority within the Council to look at peacekeepers as instruments to wage war.\" He cited its disregard of the UN Charter requirement for nations contributing troops \"to participate in the decisions\" of the Council on their deployment.  \"India, for example, has not been so consulted,\" he said. \"This despite the fact that India is the single largest contributor of troops to UN peacekeeping operations, having contributed more than 170,000 troops in 43 of the 69 peacekeeping operations mandated so far by the Council.\" India currently has 7,798 personnel serving the peacekeeping operations.  In her statement released Thursday, Power called for extending the scope of the interactions between the Council, the Secretariat and the troop-contributors. \"These consultations must extend beyond the issue of mandates of operations, and to areas such as safety and security of peacekeepers, strategic force generation, gender, conduct and discipline, including allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse, implementation of protection of civilian mandates, capability, performance, equipment and national caveat,\" she said.  The US role in shepherding the commitment through the Council in the waning days of 2015 during Power's presidency adds to its weight. With the US military capability overextended, President Barack Obama has in a break from the past shown interest in rejuvenating UN peacekeeping operations. He had convened an international summit on the subject in September.  The Council also recognised the troop-contributing countries' on-the-ground expertise. Power said, \"The experience and expertise of troop- and police-contributing countries in theatres of operation can greatly assist the planning of operations.\"  India has stressed the importance of continuing consultations to make use of the reservoir of experiences peacekeepers have. During a recent interview with IANS, Mukerji gave an example of the situation in South Sudan where Indian peacekeepers are deployed. Rights to graze cattle sparked conflicts between groups and these escalated, he said. While the Indian troops on the ground, who had been trained professionally to observe the conflict environment, were aware of it, the information had no avenue to reach the Council or the higher UN echelons, thus missing an opportunity to prevent the situation from escalating, he added.  Power said the Council also asked the Secretariat to consult with troop-and police-contributing countries when planning any change in military tasks, mission-specific rules of engagement, concept of operations or command and control structure or early peacebuilding that would impact personnel, equipment, training and logistics.  This meets another of the peacekeeping issue that India has raised about the Council changing mandates midway through a mission or introducing new elements that could affect the security of peacekeepers. The Council added a so-called intervention brigade in the Democratic Republic of Congo where Indian peacekeepers are deployed. India fears that its troops could become vulnerable to attacks stemming from the aggressive tactics mandated for the intervention brigades.", "section": "Security and Terrorism", "topics": {"ECONOMIC GROWTH": 0.07692307692307693, "GOVERNMENT, GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS": 0.3076923076923077, "NATIONAL SECURITY, TERRORISM, SECURITY AGENCY": 0.46153846153846156}, "day": 1}

I hope everybody does good work as there is space for everyone as an actor. I hope everybody does well,\" said Farhan.  \"I don't believe in this rat race of one, two and three. I hope we collaborate and encourage each other in choices of work that we do. So most of my friends in the industry, we don't discuss business (box office numbers) or other things like that. We discuss performances,\" he said.  In his soon-to-be-released film  Wazir , Farhan plays an ATS officer and the actor did not leave any stone unturned to get into the skin of his character.  \"I did research on how they (ATS officer) train, studied the protocol they follow, the body language, the way they talk and sit, conceal what is that they are thinking while talking to someone. All these things were so nice to bring to the character of Danish Khan,\" he said.  Farhan may have directed action films in past, but it was his first stint with the genre as an actor and according to him he had a fabulous time while shooting.  \"I had a great time doing action. I have directed action in films, worked closely with action directors. I did not feel out of the place,\" he said.  Producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra was working on  Wazir \u00a0since 1980 and narrated the idea to Farhan while he was working on  Lakshya .  \"He (Chopra) told me he is writing a script and will send it after which I did not hear from him for a very long time. After that I heard from him recently,\" Farhan said.  On her co-star Aditi Rao Hydari, he says, \"I have seen few people who work like her. She fills the screen.

With Manchester United and Chelsea toiling, Liverpool rebuilding under Jurgen Klopp and Manchester City damagingly porous, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger appears to have reached a decisive juncture in his 19-year tenure.  His team have been top on New Year's Day three times in the last 14 years, only to see their title hopes fade on each occasion, but Wenger feels that the current crop have what it takes to go the distance.  \"I believe that we are mature enough and that we have the requested quality to fight and compete,\" he said ahead of Saturday's home game with third-bottom Newcastle United.  \"The most important thing is to feel, at the end of the season, that we have given absolutely everything to be successful. It is not the date (New Year's Day) that is decided you win the league. It shows you that we have a good chance as the statistics show you that eight of the past 11 years, the team who was top on New Year's Day won it.\"  Arsenal continue to nurse frailties of their own, as shown by their 4-0 Boxing Day drubbing at Southampton, but Monday's 2-0 win over Bournemouth was enough to take them top of the table on goal difference after former leaders Leicester City could only draw 0-0 with Manchester City.  Leicester lost 1-0 at Liverpool prior to Tuesday's goalless stalemate with City, but manager Claudio Ranieri says that his players are determined not to let their early-season momentum peter out.  \"We've had a fantastic half-season, it's unbelievable what we are doing and we must continue,\" said the Italian, whose team welcome Bournemouth to the King Power Stadium on Saturday.  \"We will fight right until the end and we want to win. If we give 100 percent, then we accept every result.\"  Manchester City, three points off the pace in third place, continue to oscillate between the sublime and the ridiculous and have gone 10 league games without recording back-to-back victories.  \u00a0  Against Watford they will once again be without skipper Vincent Kompany, after he aggravated a calf injury during the 4-1 Boxing Day win over Sunderland, and manager Manuel Pellegrini admits that he is desperate to get to the bottom of the influential centre-back's injury problems.  \"We are trying to do all (we can) to know how we can help Vincent to try to be fit and not to continue with the same calf problems,\" the Chilean told his pre-match press conference on New Year's Eve. Everything the club can do, we are going to do it.\"  City's travails have given hope to Tottenham Hotspur, who are just a point behind them in fourth place prior to their trip to Everton on Sunday, when they will be chasing a fourth successive league win.  Spurs' form is also of concern to both Liverpool and United, who find themselves five points off the Champions League places at the season's halfway stage. Speculation about United manager Louis van Gaal's future has quietened down since Monday's 0-0 draw with Chelsea, but the volume will rise quickly if his side fail to produce an adequate performance at home to Swansea City, who have won the last three encounters between the teams.  \"We have to get points, otherwise the gap is too big and that is why we have to do what we have to do,\" Van Gaal said.  \"We have to work, prepare the game, perform and then evaluate the game again. That is of course much more difficult when you don't win than when you win.\"  Champions Chelsea, three points above the relegation zone, visit fifth-place London rivals Crystal Palace on Sunday with Guus Hiddink still seeking the first win of his second stint as interim manager.  Meanwhile, neither bottom club Aston Villa nor second-bottom Sunderland can afford defeat in their showdown at the Stadium of Light, with the two teams respectively 11 and seven points from safety.  \u00a0", "section": "Sports", "topics": {"INTERNATIONAL SPORTS": 0.7777777777777778, "TRENDING ISSUES": 0.1111111111111111}, "day": 1}

Anger  is typically a reaction to any factor, often a secondary emotion than  can arise as a reaction to other emotions such as insecurity, jealousy  and fear, says Dr. Samir Parikh, director, mental health and behavioural  sciences, Fortis Healthcare Limited.  \"It is a natural response  by our body, which triggers the 'fight or flight' response in perception  of potential threat, attack, injustice or disappointment,\" Parikh said.  Though anger is an emotion which is experienced by every  person at some point of time, it seems like more and more people,  including children, are increasingly losing their cool easily. The  fast-paced life is to be blamed for the same, says Dr. Sanju Ghambir,  senior consultant psychotherapy and counselling, Primus Super Specialty  Hospital.  \"We are getting a lot of patients now. They have a lot  of anger in them because they don't have patience. We are living in a  time where everything is instant. All we have to do is go online. When  we don't get results fast, that's when people start getting angry.  \"Children  as young as three show anger. Be it sibling rivalry or not getting toy  of their choice, anything can be the reason. Sometimes, even watching  cartoons leads to anger because there is a lot of violence in that,\"  Ghambir added.  Earlier, there were more cases of men losing  temper, but now with the demand for equality, women are no longer hiding  their emotions, she pointed out.  \"Now even women are expressing  anger. More women are becoming aware of their own role. With that in  mind, women also feel why they should keep quiet. So that role of  keeping quiet to control the situation is going out now because a woman  has her own ego to satisfy,\" she said.  It might seem like people become calmer as they grow older. But Ghambir says age has nothing to do with it.  \"A  person who is able to adjust, learns to control himself better, whereas  a person who is always looking at the things that he lacks, that person  will always be dissatisfied and angry. If they have stress related to  money and relationship, then the anger might just go up,\" she said.  Anger could have both physical and psychological manifestations.  \"The  common physical signs of anger include sweating, headaches and  restlessness. It arouses the nervous system, leading to an increase in  heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and other regulatory  functions of the body.  \"Frequent anger is likely to lead to  adverse impacts on the person's physical health, increasing the risk for  illnesses like hypertension or cardiovascular diseases, sleep  disturbance, skin problem, in addition to interference in occupational,  social, and interpersonal functioning,\" Parikh added.  There are long-term effects of anger too.  \"It  could lead to an adverse impact on one's psychological well-being,  leading to difficulty in attention and concentration, difficulty in  decision making, increased anxiety and depression,\" said Parikh.  Anger is also a common cause for stomach ulcer.  \"A  lot of acid secretion in stomach takes place that damages our body from  within. Anger is a very common cause for stomach ulcer,\" said Ghambir.  Going by the health problems, it's best to manage anger.  Atul Verma, senior psychologist from SCI International Hospital, suggests how.  \"Expression  is the act of conveying your anger. Expression ranges from a  reasonable, rational discussion to a violent outburst. Suppression is an  attempt to hold in your anger and possibly convert it into more  constructive behaviour.  \"Calming down is when you control your  outward behaviour and your internal responses by calming yourself and  letting your feelings subside like counting numbers backward, taking a  deep breath at the time when you feel angry,\" he said.  Parikh suggests physical exercise too.  \"When  a person is angry, the individual experiences a surge of energy, which  typically is externalised in the form of shouting, or aggression.  Instead, the person should be encouraged to have regular physical  activity, be it in the form of a sport, workout, dance or even walking  or jogging,\" he said.", "section": "Health", "topics": {"WEATHER, CALAMITIES": 0.2, "HEALTH AND LIVING": 0.3, "TRENDING ISSUES": 0.1}, "day": 1}

Expression ranges from a  reasonable, rational discussion to a violent outburst. Suppression is an  attempt to hold in your anger and possibly convert it into more  constructive behaviour.  \"Calming down is when you control your  outward behaviour and your internal responses by calming yourself and  letting your feelings subside like counting numbers backward, taking a  deep breath at the time when you feel angry,\" he said.  Parikh suggests physical exercise too.  \"When  a person is angry, the individual experiences a surge of energy, which  typically is externalised in the form of shouting, or aggression.  Instead, the person should be encouraged to have regular physical  activity, be it in the form of a sport, workout, dance or even walking  or jogging,\" he said.", "section": "Health", "topics": {"WEATHER, CALAMITIES": 0.2, "HEALTH AND LIVING": 0.4}, "day": 1}

About 1.50 lakh RSS workers are expected to attend the gathering which would be held across 450 acres near Hinjewadi IT Park on the outskirts of Pune.  Workers from western Maharashtra districts of Pune, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Satara, Sangli, Solapur and Kolhapur have registered themselves for the gathering to be addressed by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat.  Coordinator of the event Sarang Wable said it would be the biggest conclave of the RSS workers in the recent past.  He said the main purpose of the gathering was to reach out to civil societies and social service organisations in the country.  \"The purpose of the meet is to project Sangh as a positive force in the society, and to further open up to the wider audience. The main thing we want to highlight is the ideals of discipline practised among the followers of Sangh.  We felt there is a need to showcase the core aspects of the Sangh to important people in the society,\" Wable said.

We are hopeful that the last person could also hear each and every word loud and clear,\" he said.  The food will be served in eco-friendly plates made up of supari (betel nut) leaves.  Noted art designer Nitin Desai has set up a nine-storey replica of Raigad Fort from where Bhagwat will address the gathering.  Sarkaryawah Suresh Joshi will also be present during the address.

Politwoops is the only comprehensive collection of deleted tweets by politicians that offers a window into what they hoped you did not see.  New CEO Jack Dorsey in October last year spoke about Twitter's responsibilities to developers and users in the areas of government transparency.  \"We have a responsibility to continue to empower organisations that bring more transparency to public dialogue, such as Politwoops,\" he reiterated.  In a latest post on Thursday, Colin Crowell, vice president for global public policy at Twitter, wrote that the company is pleased to announce an agreement with the Sunlight Foundation and the Open State Foundation around Politwoops.  Politwoops is supposed to be accessible in the \"coming days and weeks\", according to the watchdog group the Sunlight Foundation.  \"Politwoops is an important tool for holding our public officials, including candidates and elected or appointed public officials, accountable for the statements they make. We are glad that we have been able to reach an agreement with Twitter to bring it back online both in the US and internationally,\" said Jenn Topper, communications director for the Sunlight Foundation.  This agreement is great news for those who believe that the world needs more transparency.  \"Our next step is now to continue and expand our work to enable the public to hold public officials accountable for their public statements,\" added Arjan El Fassed, director of watchdog group Open State Foundation that launched Politwoops in more than 30 countries since 2010.  Brett Solomon, executive director of the global digital rights organisation Access Now, said that in many parts of the world, Twitter is a central component of the public record.  \"Re-establishing a mechanism to record, store and publish deleted tweets of politicians and public officials further demonstrates Twitter's commitment to transparency and political accountability,\" he wrote.  As Twitter becomes a more important platform for political discourse, it is essential that politicians and public official's tweets remain online and accessible to the general public.  \"We look forward to continuing our work with these important organisations and using Twitter to bring more transparency to public dialogue,\" Crowell noted.", "section": "Issues", "topics": {"TRENDING ISSUES": 0.9090909090909091}, "day": 1}

The 15-year cycle of the anti-poverty Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) came to an end with 2015 paving the way for the SDGs, an even more ambitious set of goals to banish a host of social ills by 2030.   \"The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are our shared vision of humanity and a social contract between the world's leaders and the people,\" UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had said of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted unanimously by 193 Heads of State and other top leaders at a summit here in September.   \"They are a to-do list for people and planet, and a blueprint for success,\" he had said of the 17 goals and 169 targets to wipe out poverty, fight inequality and tackle climate change over the next 15 years.   The official ushering in of the new 15-year cycle takes place over a 24-hour period, coming into effect in each region of the planet at the stroke of midnight Thursday.   India is seen as critical for the success of the SDGs, given that improving the lives of 1.4 billion Indians would make a major dent in the goal of improving the lives of all humanity. Even before the SDGs came into effect, India told the UN that it is already implementing the new goals in the form of several initiatives launched by the Indian government.   \"We believe that the SDGs are in themselves a strong endorsement of the developmental vision articulated by the Indian government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,\" India had said on the adoption of the outcome document of the Agenda 2030 at the final session of intergovernmental negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda in August.   \"In fact, most if not all the initiatives launched by Prime Minister Modi can be related to one or more of the SDGs.   In this sense, the SDGs are already being implemented in India,\" it said.   Ambitious programmes launched by the Indian government like 'Make in India', 'Digital India', 'Smart Cities' and the 'Skills India' initiative aim at boosting economic development and manufacturing in the country and help lift millions out of poverty.

This also heralded a new era for ISRO as India faced an embargo from the US post nuclear test in 1973 and 1997, which hampered its space programme.  For its work, including the success of Mars Orbiter Mission, India's first inter-planetary mission, ISRO was awarded the Gandhi Peace Prize and Space Pioneer Award by US- based National Space Society.  However, ISRO also had its share of controversies. In September, an international tribunal asked Antrix, ISRO's commercial arm, to pay USD 672 million to Devas in the controversial Antrix-Devas case.  There were complaints about the manner in which the deal was entered into and the way in which it was being operationalised. In 2011, the Centre had annulled the controversial deal between the Antrix Corporation and Bangalore-based Devas Multimedia.  On the other hand, the nuclear sector saw resolution to major impending issues.  Ahead of President Barack Obama's visit to India as Republic Day chief guest of 2015, India addressed the concerns raised by domestic as well as foreign players on the clauses of Civil Liability Nuclear Damages Act 2010. Following this, a Nuclear Insurance Pool was formed and operationalised.  The passage of the amendment to the Atomic Energy Act 1962 in the Winter Session of Parliament for enabling NPCIL to enter into joint ventures with other PSUs, will help expand nuclear energy production in India.", "section": "Infrastructure", "topics": {"POWER & ENERGY AND RELATED COMPANIES": 0.5454545454545454, "BUSINESS AND COMPANIES": 0.09090909090909091, "EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTES, ENTREPRENEURSHIPS, RESEARCH": 0.2727272727272727}, "day": 1}

The Japanese airline plans to introduce the double-decker planes on flights to Hawaii and other overseas destinations, in an effort to boost its international business.  The company paid about 150 billion Yen (USD 1.23 billion) for the three A380 planes, which have 500 seats, more than double the number of spots on ANA planes that currently fly to Hawaii, the business daily said.  In 2014, ANA was ahead of its rival Japan Airlines (JAL) in terms of passenger count on international flights, but JAL served more people on the Tokyo to Hawaii route -- 35 per cent of all Hawaii-bound passengers compared to ANA's 20 per cent.  ANA hopes the superjumbo jet purchase will give it a leg up and allow it to increase the number of people it serves on flights to Hawaii.  About 1.5 million people travel from Japan to Hawaii ever year, according to the Hawaiian Tourism Authority.  ANA's domestic rival Skymark Airlines signed a contract with Airbus in 2011 to buy six A380 jets, but the superjumbo manufacturer cancelled the 2.2 billion order in July 2014, apparently over concerns it would not get paid.  In October, ANA announced six-month net profits soared 51 percent as a jump in inbound tourism boosted its international business, while falling oil prices also helped the airlines' finances.", "section": "Infrastructure", "topics": {"AVIATION, AIRPORTS": 0.46153846153846156}, "day": 1}

The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) designed for plateau missions are usually installed with high span chord ratio wings, which provides more lifting force at a relatively low airspeed.  The UAVs employ high span chord ratio wings but tend to lose their maneuverability.  Hence, they usually need larger turning radius and unable to maintain the altitude during sharp slope turning as the lifting force produced by the wings decrease dramatically when the bank angle is large.  The discarding of the flight performances may risk the safety of the flight in plateau mountain regions.  \u201cThe new Variable thrust direction (VTD) technology is a type of thrust vectoring control (TVC) approach that allows to manipulate the directions of thrust to the fuselage of the aircraft,\u201d the authors noted in a paper published in the journal SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences.  By the introduction of the VTD capability to the conventional propeller UAV, the maneuverability of the UAV has been greatly enhanced, since the VTD engine enables direct force control of the aircraft.  Most of the existing works are designed for jet engines, which cannot be applied to the conventional propeller engine aircraft.  The VTD mechanism allows redirecting parts portion of the thrust from the propeller engine to other directions rather than normal axial direction.  A combination flight controller for the VTD enhanced UAV is then proposed to coordinate the VTD controlled forces and aerodynamic surfaces forces.  \u201cThe newly developed VTD UAV was applied to implement plateau missions, which demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed technique,\u201d the team added.", "section": "Security and Terrorism", "topics": {"TENNIS": 0.1111111111111111, "NATIONAL SECURITY, TERRORISM, SECURITY AGENCY": 0.4444444444444444, "HEALTH AND LIVING": 0.1111111111111111, "EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTES, ENTREPRENEURSHIPS, RESEARCH": 0.1111111111111111}, "day": 1}

The roads which usually remain jam-packed witnessed low traffic flow as the odd-numbered cars allowed to ply while the even-numbered cars mostly remained off the roads.  To lead by example, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal carpooled with two of his ministers, Gopal Rai and Satyendra Jain, while Tourism and Culture Minister Kapil Mishra rode his bike to office. Volunteers of the Civil Defence and National Cadet Corps (NCC) assisted the Delhi Police to man traffic. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) volunteers were there too in full force. Even school students came out to the streets to request commuters to follow the odd-even scheme.\u00a0  Tourism Minister Kapil Mishra reached the Secretariat on his two-wheeler at around 9 am and tweeted, \u201cWow Delhi Thank you for making #OddEvenFormula a success...just reached office on bike.. no traffic.. Delhi is following it voluntarily.\u201d\u00a0Two-wheelers are included in the list of 25 categories that have been kept out of the ambit of the scheme.  Around 11 am Transport Minister Rai took a bus ride to get a first-hand idea about how the odd-even scheme was getting implemented. Rai took the bus from Pragati Maidan which travelled to India Gate, Connaught Place, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg and ITO before heading back to the Delhi Secretariat.  Microblogging site Twitter was also abuzz as Delhiites posted pictures and expressed their happiness on the successful implementation of the scheme on the first day. Comedian Abish Mathew tweeted, \"I really want this #OddEvenPlan to work so well that people use it even when it's not enforced!\"\u00a0  Delhi resident Amit tweeted: \"Since last 8-9 years I have never seen Delhi Cantt Road like this !! Thank you Mr. CM Kejriwal #IamWithOddEven.\u201d  Arif Khan tweeted: \"Here we go to #DelhiOddEven live from today. Almost half cars at my neighbourhood signal at Vasant Kunj.\"  Ayaz Siddiqui tweeted: \"Today I'm doing #carpooling. What about you? #Delhi #OddEven #OddEvenPlan #OddEvenFormula #PollutionFreeDelhi #Pollution #DelhiForOddEven\"  Echoing similar views and applauding Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders for following the scheme, former AAP leader Anjali Damania wrote, \"Now this is great @naqvimukhtar of BJP welcomes #OddEvenPlan & @Gupta_vijender & few BJP ldrs (leaders) taking to cycles. This is the need of the hour.\"  Delhi Traffic Police on the roads said that the odd-even scheme has been a success so far. \u201cTraffic on regular days at Delhi Gate Junction used to be heavy, but today there is minimal traffic,\u201d said a traffic police official.  Chief Minister Kejriwal took to Twitter to respond to the overwhelming response to the trial scheme. \"Delhi has done it! Reports so far v (very) encouraging. Delhiites! U (you) give me hope that U (you) are capable of achieving big challenges.\"  Earlier, in another tweet, the chief minister wrote that he would carpool with his ministers and secretary. \"Am (I am) pooling my car n (and) going to office with 2 ministers, my PS and my Joint Secy (secretary),\" Kejriwal wrote.  Transport Minister Rai called up Police Commissioner BS Bassi, transport commissioner Parimal Rai and divisional commissioner AN Anbarasu to discuss issues related to the odd-even trial scheme.  Volunteers and officials were in action from the wee hours to monitor the implementation of the scheme. There were some violators who were challaned. The first violator was flagged down at around 8.30 am at the ITO. At Anand Vihar and Delhi Gate junction volunteers and traffic police personnel were seen requesting people to follow the rules and take their even-numbered car off the road.  Civil Defence volunteer Naaz Khan, who is in charge at the ITO, told thestatesman.com that there are eight volunteers at that crossing. At Delhi Gate crossing six volunteers were seen manning the traffic. Volunteer Imran Alam said: \u201cOur main job is to help the traffic police. We are here to spread awareness among the people. If anyone is not following the odd-even rule, we will explain them the new guidelines.\u201d  Many volunteers stood holding placards with messages like, \"I will make Delhi pollution free\" and gave red roses to the violators while requesting them to follow the rules. Additional Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses were also pressed into service. Delhi Metro increased the frequency of its trains.  This odd-even formula may be a bane for the commuters, but for some it is a boon. \"Expecting more income and passengers,\" autorickshaw driver Dharmendra said.  While the first day of odd-even scheme seems to be a success, the real test will begin on Monday (January 4) when more office-goers will hit the roads and public transport buses will have to accommodate more commuters.\u00a0  Read more:  Truly overwhelmed: Arvind Kejriwal on odd-even trial  Delhi\u2019s odd-even trial begins: First violator challaned  Odd-even trial: Volunteers join cops to enforce plan  Click here for images  \u00a0  \u00a0", "section": "Government", "topics": {"MINISTRY AND DEPARTMENTS, MINISTERS": 0.09090909090909091, "METRO AND DEVELOPMENT": 0.5454545454545454}, "day": 1}

Although the genetic cause of DMD has been known for nearly 30 years, no effective treatments exist.\u00a0  The disease breaks down muscle fibres and replaces them with fibrous or fatty tissue, causing the muscle to gradually weaken. This condition often results in heart muscle disease, or cardiomyopathy, the leading cause of death in these patients.  For the study, the researchers used a gene-editing approach to permanently correct the DMD mutation that causes the disease in young mice.  \"This is different from other therapeutic approaches, because it eliminates the cause of the disease,\" said senior author Eric Olson from University of Texas Southwestern Medical Centre in the US.  In 2014, Olson's team first used this technique - called CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing - to correct the mutation in the germ line of mice and prevent muscular dystrophy.  This paved the way for novel genome editing-based therapeutics in DMD. It also raised several challenges for clinical applications of gene editing.\u00a0  Since germ line editing is not feasible in humans, strategies would need to be developed to deliver gene-editing components to postnatal tissues.  To test this out, researchers delivered gene-editing components to the mice via adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9). DMD mice treated with this technique produced dystrophin protein and progressively showed improved structure and function of skeletal muscle and heart.  \"This study represents a very important translational application of genome editing of DMD mutations in young mice. It is a solid step toward a practical cure for DMD,\" Rhonda Bassel-Duby, professor at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Centre, noted.  \"Importantly, in principle, the same strategy can be applied to numerous types of mutations within the human DMD patients,\" Olson said.

The industry has witnessed a growth of 52 percent over 2015 and has emerged as one of the fastest growing sectors.  \"Increasing  internet and mobile penetration, growing acceptability of online  payments and favorable demographics has provided the e-commerce sector  in India the unique opportunity to companies connect with their  customers,\" the Assocham paper said.

Delhi has nearly 30 lakh private cars, with hundreds of new cars being added every month. Together with motorcycles (over 30 lakh), vans (74,000) and other vehicles, the total adds to 90 lakh private vehicles on the streets of Delhi. That\u2019s quite a big number.  Delhi has over three lakh commercial vehicles, \u00a0including over 80,000 three-wheelers.

The normally crowded streets of the capital saw empty spaces, and cars were able to zip along smoothly. What probably helped matters was that it is New Year\u2019s Day and many private offices were closed.  But New Year\u2019s Day is also a day on which Delhiites love to be out, meet friends, eat out and shop.  So, for most people it must have been quite a sacrifice to stay at home, or choose to travel by public transport to their destinations.  Who would want to get pushed around in crowded buses or metros, and wait at bus stands/auto stands, when one could easily reach office or their destination easily in their own vehicle.  One did not see too many police or civil defence personnel on the streets to ensure compliance, probably the stiff Rs.2,000 fine for violators also ensured people obeyed the rules.\u00a0  Delhiites are keen to cooperate to make the city breathable again, and for that  kuch bhi chalega.

The team from Pennsylvania State University used Fast Radio Bursts (brief blasts of rare radio signals from space) which are 10-100 times better than previous testing methods that used gamma-ray bursts.  The new method is considered to be a significant tribute to Einstein on the 100th anniversary of his first formulation of the Equivalence Principle which is a key component of Einstein's theory of General Relativity.  \u201cWith abundant observational information in the future, we can gain a better understanding of the physical nature of Fast Radio Bursts,\u201d said Peter Meszaros, professor of Physics at Penn State.  More broadly, the new method is a key component of the concept that the geometry of spacetime is curved by the mass density of individual galaxies, stars, planets and other objects.  Fast Radio Bursts are super-brief blasts of energy -- lasting just a few milliseconds.  Until now, only about a dozen Fast Radio Bursts have been detected on Earth.  They appear to be caused by mysterious events beyond our Milky Way Galaxy and possibly even beyond the galaxies that includes the Milky Way.  The new technique will be important for analysing the abundance of observations of Fast Radio Bursts that advanced radio-signal observatories, now being planned, are expected to detect.  Like all other forms of electromagnetic radiation including visible light, Fast Radio Bursts travel through space as waves of photon particles.  With the new method, \u201cwe will also be able to use Fast Radio Bursts as a probe of their host galaxies, of the space between galaxies, of the cosmic-web structure of the universe, and as a test of fundamental physics\u201d, Meszaros explained.  Einstein's Equivalence Principle requires that any two photons of different frequencies, emitted at the same time from the same source and traveling through the same gravitational fields should arrive at Earth at exactly the same time.  If Einstein's Equivalence Principle is correct, any time delay that might occur between these two photons should not be due to the gravitational fields they experienced during their travels, but should be due only to other physical effects.  \u201cBy measuring how closely in time the two different-frequency photons arrive, we can test how closely they obey Einstein's Equivalence Principle,\u201d the authors noted.

The encounters will not be the usual 21-point  game; to make it shorter and peppier they will be 15-point  contests.  Moreover, every tie is to have two men\u2019s singles, women\u2019s  singles, men\u2019s doubles and mixed doubles.\u00a0Not  to forget, each team will get to strategically select one of the five  matches that they play in a tie as their \"trump match\" where a victory  gives the team a bonus point and a loss gives it a negative point.  A  team cannot put the same player in the \"trump matches\" proposed by them  more than twice in the league stage and once in the knockout stage.  Besides, each team shall have a minimum and maximum of 10 players, of  which at least four should be Indian players. Also, at least two matches  out of the five in a tie will have Indian participation. No player can  play more than two matches in a tie.   The tournament, which will be played between six teams of different cities between\u00a0January 2 and 17,  will have star attractions. While Saina Nehwal, PV Sindhu and P Kashyap  will be seen competing with each other, there will be international  stars like Lee Chong Wei and Gabby Adcock to name a few.    The  league was a hit in its first year, but due to legal cases and reasons  best known to the Badminton Association of India and organisers, it had  to be scrapped.

A drunk man died after he embraced a giant firecracker, called \"Goodbye Philippines\", as it was about to explode, health secretary Janet Garin told reporters.  \"His jaw was shattered. He was so intoxicated he hugged the Goodbye Philippines,\" Garin said, adding the man was pronounced dead at the hospital.  Eighty percent of the country's 100 million people are Catholic but Filipino superstition dictates making ear-shattering noises during New Year's Eve to ward off bad luck.  Revellers set off firecrackers and shoot guns into the air to celebrate the December festive season.  The health department listed 380 injuries due to fireworks and four others due to stray bullets.  In many hospitals across the country, firecracker victims rushed into emergency rooms grimacing in pain as they held their bloodied limbs.  An eight-year-old boy in the northern farming province of Nueva Vizcaya had three of his fingers amputated after a firecracker exploded in his hands, Garin said. At least nine children had their fingers amputated due to firecracker injuries, she said.\u00a0  In a Manila shantytown, a lit firecracker started a slum inferno, which quickly spread, fire bureau spokesman Renato Marcial said.  The blaze destroyed a cramped maze of wood and cardboard huts in the early hours of Friday, leaving 3,000 people homeless, city disaster officer Johnny Yu said.  Panicked and weeping residents fled their burning homes carrying clothes and furniture while men, many of whom were drunk from a night of merrymaking, desperately tried to put out the fire with buckets of water, an AFP photographer at the scene saw.  A 65-year-old woman died from a heart attack as she watched her house burn, Yu said.  Many Filipino civilians keep licensed guns in their homes to protect themselves in a high-crime society and most firecrackers are legal and easily available.  The 384 injuries recorded so far for 2015 are up from 354 in 2014.\u00a0", "section": "Finance", "topics": {"ECONOMIC GROWTH": 0.4444444444444444, "CRIME": 0.1111111111111111}, "day": 1}

In a  three-pager addressed to Modi, Hazare has said that it is imperative to  implement the Lok Pal and Lokayukta to \"control corruption to an  extent\" and give a fair price to agriculture produce to stop farmers'  suicides in the country.  The 79-year-old pointed out how before  the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Modi promised that if the Bharatiya Janata  Party was voted to power, he would strive to make the country  \"corruption-free\".  \"However, even now corruption has not  decreased, no work can be done without paying bribes... Even inflation  has not been curbed. In the matter of corruption, there is no difference  between the UPA and NDA governments,\" Hazare wrote.  He reminded  Modi that when he first stepped inside parliament, he  vowed to maintain  its sanctity like a temple: \"But parliament sessions are lost in  fights-arguments... crores of rupees of public money is being wasted.\"  Touching  upon a sensitive issue, Hazare recalled how Modi promised to get back  the black money stashed abroad \"within 100 days\" and each Indian would  get Rs.15 lakh in his bank account. \"But that has not happened till now,  forget Rs.15 lakh, people have not got even Rs.15.\"  \"You are  neither speaking about the Lok Pal and Lokayukta laws nor implementing  them. We had hopes that you would address them in your 'Mann Ki Baat'  (PM's monthly radio address to the nation), especially since you had  assured that you would tackle corruption,\" Hazare said.  On the  agriculture front, he said the government promised 1.5 times returns to  the farming community, but since that remains unimplemented, farmers  suicides continue to plague farmlands across India.  Hazare added  that in the past, former prime ministers like P.V. Narasimha Rao used to  call and speak with him occasionally, even A.B. Vajpayee would enquire  about him whenever he travelled to Maharashtra, while Manmohan Singh -  whom he had targeted - also used to reply to his letters.  \"Perhaps  you get angry by my letters and they end up in the dustbin... I am just  an ordinary citizen who is powerless against the government, at best I  can launch an agitation...,\" Hazare said, from his village in Ahmedbagar  district of the state.", "section": "Finance", "topics": {"MINISTRY AND DEPARTMENTS, MINISTERS": 0.2, "STATE GOVERNMENT, GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS": 0.1, "ECONOMIC GROWTH": 0.3}, "day": 1}

Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) released the results of its analysis of the official air quality data from continuous monitoring by Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to show how this winter pollution levels have worsened compared to last year.  \"Both November and December 2015 show higher number of days in 'severe' category, the worst category according to the National Air Quality Index. November had 73 per cent of days in severe category against 53 per cent in November 2014.  \"December 2014 had at least 3 per cent of days in 'good' and 'satisfactory' category but December 2015 has none. There has not been a single 'good' air quality day this winter,\" the CSE analysis said.  It said that this justifies emergency action like the odd and even system that Delhi should pilot successfully to reduce toxic exposure during smog episodes.  \"If globally smog episode is defined as three consecutive days in the worst category of the air quality index, then the 2015 winter has already witnessed 11 such smog episodes. Such levels have lasted for 10 consecutive days as well,\" it said.  CSE said in its analysis that if with public support half of the cars are off the road, the total toxic load of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides can also be halved from the car segment.  \"Total toxins, including benzene, PAH and other cancer causing substances can also be cut. More reduction is possible from diesel cars and SUVs,\" it said.  CSE has urged that the odd and even number system be enforced with stringency to help develop alternative commuting practices and systems that can be sustained on a longer-term basis.  \"Given the level of choking pollution in the city and its health impact, people need to support to reduce their pollution foot print. Despite the exemptions granted to two-wheelers and women, voluntary participation is critical to reduce public health risk in the city.  \"Delhi government should take this opportunity to improve the public transport services. Reduced congestion will be an opportunity to make the public transport perform more efficiently,\" it said.\u00a0  CSE said that a user of single occupancy petrol car meeting Bharat Stage IV standards can reduce per capita particulate emissions per kilometer by at least two times by using a CNG bus and benefit will be higher if the shift is from cars meeting older emissions norms.  At the same time, it said that a user of single occupancy diesel car meeting Bharat Stage IV can reduce per capita particulate emissions per kilometer by at least 40 times by using a CNG bus.  It said that the programme will also allow enormous fuel savings and mitigation of heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions.  \"Per capita CO2 emissions from a single occupancy petrol car can reduce by 15 times with shift to buses. Also, per capita CO2 emissions from a single occupancy diesel car can reduce by 13 times with shift to buses and SUVs to 22 times.  This translates into substantial fuel savings,\" it said.  From a public health perspective, the green body said it would be misleading to underestimate the impact of vehicular pollution that occurs very close to our breathing zone.  It said that the IIT Kanpur study has shown that in winter, vehicles are the second largest emitters of PM2.5 after road dust, if both combustion sources and dust sources are considered. But it is the top emitters among the combustion sources in winter.  Moreover, in different parts of Delhi, diesel four- wheelers are the source of at least 60-70 per cent of PM2.5 in winter. Several other studies in Delhi have shown how real- time exposure on roads and close to roadside are several times higher than the background ambient levels, the green body said.  Noting that vehicular emissions contain some of the deadliest toxins like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and benzene which are more in diesel emissions, CSE said that serious health impacts have been associated with emissions from traffic.  It said that a recently released mega study in the US by the Health Effect Institute has implicated PM2.5 from diesel and coal with increased incidence of deaths due to ischemic heart disease.  \"This is serious given the fact that India's global burden of disease estimates have found half of the premature deaths due to air pollution related diseases in India are due to heart ailments.

United enjoyed their last EPL victory on  November 21 at Watford. They have lost three of the six matches since,  but produced an improved performance in the goalless draw with Chelsea  at Old Trafford on Monday.  They will next face  relegation-threatened Swansea City at home on Saturday and van Gaal  feels that sixth-placed United have a strong chance of closing the gap  on league leaders Arsenal and Leicester City.  United are currently on 30 points while both Arsenal and Leicester City have 39. But Arsenal lead Leicester on goal difference.  \"We  need to win because we want to be at the end at the top of the league  and not in the middle. We have to get points, otherwise the gap is too  big and that is why we have to do what we have to do. Work, do the  things, prepare the game, perform and then evaluate the game again. That  is much more difficult when you don't win. All the things you say as a  manager is more accepted (when you win),\" van Gaal was quoted as saying  by the Guardian.  The 64-year-old Dutchman admitted that United  are under pressure to re-ignite their tittle challenge, but asserted  that the players will have to live up to the challenge.  \"Pressure  is what you experience yourself and by the players. Most important are  the players because they have to perform. They have to give everything  and that is the most difficult aspect. That is the players' function.  You have to show it for 90 minutes against the resistance of the  opponent and also under the pressure of the environment and the pressure  you put yourself under. You have to cope with that,\" he said.  Van  Gaal does not have happy memories of his meetings with Swansea as  United have lost to the EPL strugglers in all their previous matches  under his guidance. But with Swansea struggling with their form in  recent matches, van Gaal is confident that United are in with a chance.  Swansea picked up only their second win in 14 EPL matches against West Bromwich Albion on Boxing Day.  \"I  was three times losing against Swansea, and then you have to evaluate  why you lost,\" Van Gaal said. \"It is always like that, then you continue  with the same vicious circle of working. There is no magic. It is  looking at what has happened and what can improve, as a team but also as  an individual player,\" van Gaal said.  \"You make a game plan to  beat your opponent and then you have to convince your players. Then you  have to train and then you have to be convinced. Then you can be  committed and try to perform it,\" he added.", "section": "Sports", "topics": {"POWER & ENERGY AND RELATED COMPANIES": 0.2, "INTERNATIONAL SPORTS": 0.6}, "day": 1}

This led to a barometer index of  the Indian equity markets to provisionally close the day's trade on a  flat note with a gain of a   mere 31 points.  Initially, both the  bellwether indices of the Indian equity markets opened in the red, due  to lack of participation coupled with disappointing macro data that  prompted some investors to book profits at lower levels.  Besides,  investors were seen cautious regarding the upcoming macro data of  purchasing mangers' index (PMI) slated to be released on Monday and the  third-quarter earnings season which starts from January 14.  However,  bellwether indices soon pared their losses on the back of  short-coverings and hopes that the RBI will reduce key lending rates  after Thursday's disappointing macro data points.  Even the expectations that Nifty would breach the 8,000-level mark and minor value buying at the lower levels pushed up prices.  The barometer 30-scrip sensitive index (Sensex) of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) gained 31 points, or 0.12 percent.  The  wider 50-scrip Nifty of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) ended flat.

That, in turn, could help the Delhi government to take some more initiatives to clean up the air.  The positive response from Delhiites has certainly encouraged Delhi Transport Minister Gopal Rai, who said that the AAP government is committed to bring down the air pollution level in the city.  \u201cOur government is committed to bring down the pollution level. In August, we had organised a conference on the worsening pollution level. We invited experts from across the country to that conference and discussed the reasons behind the air pollution. We concluded that vehicular pollution increases air pollution by 30 per cent. It was then that we decided to organise car-free days in the national capital. There were all kinds of views about the initiative, but it was successful. And that gave us the confidence to move ahead,\u201d Rai told  thestatesman.com .\u00a0  Talking about the violators of the odd-even scheme on day one, the transport minister said, \u201cToday the traffic police are not focusing on issuing challans. Priorities are vigilance and awareness. We cannot say that there were no violators on Friday, but they were few in number. People are cooperating. Some of the violators returned back when the Civil Defence volunteers requested them not to violate the odd-even scheme.\u201d  He, however, admitted that the real test would be on January 4 (Monday) with office-goers out in full strength. \u201cPeople must decide what should be their priority\u2026 to drive their cars or to breathe in clean air,\u201d Rai said. \u201cI believe they would cooperate on Monday too.\u201d  While Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said that the odd-even scheme cannot be a permanent solution, Rai sounded hopeful that there could be a second phase of implementing this formula. \u201cIf everything goes well, in the second phase we shall include motorbikes as well.

Many  Jewish groups have welcomed this particular publication, saying it is  important to have access to a critical edition to help explain the  Holocaust.  'Mein Kampf' was originally printed in 1925 - eight years before Hitler came to power.  After Nazi Germany was defeated in 1945, the Allied forces handed the copyright to the book to the state of Bavaria.  The  local authorities have refused to allow the book to be reprinted to  prevent incitement of hatred, although the book was so widely printed  during the war that it remained relatively easily available.

Satish Babu, chair, Internet Society - Trivandrum Chapter, and vice chairman of the Asia-Pacific Regional At-Large Organisation of ICANN, made the observation here while speaking on the topic \"Recent Developments in Internet Governance\".  Permission-less innovation is the principle that allows anyone to deliver a service to the global community of internet users, without the need for permission from any central authority.  Babu pointed out that well-known examples include Google, Amazon and Facebook where entrepreneurs started out with little more than a dream.  \"No other medium in the history of humankind has had such potential and global reach as the internet, and it was unfortunate to see practices such as zero-rating that restricted the neutrality and unified global nature of the internet,\" said Babu.  He added that governing internet was a complex and challenging task given its globally distributed nature, lack of centralized authority, jurisdiction issues, diversity of stakeholders, diversity of services, and plurality of content.  \"Although the multilateral model -- loosely structured on the basis of UN system -- had been proposed, it is the Multi-Stakeholder Model that is accepted today as the most appropriate,\" said Babu.  In the Multi-Stakeholder Governance Model, all the stakeholders in a given system, who, in the case of the internet, include businesses, governments, research institutions, NGOs and civil society, are given formal roles in the governance process.  He also pointed out that in the internet ecosystem, organisations such as ICANN, ISOC and IGF (Internet Governance Forum) follow the Multi-Stakeholder Model of Governance, which enables all stakeholders to make them heard in the policy development process.  ISOC is an international not-for-profit society set up in 1992 as a result of efforts by several internet pioneers such as Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn, mandated with a mission to promote the open development, evolution and use of the internet.  It has over 55,000 individual and 130 intitutional members organised through about 100 chapters around the world.

Beijing resorted to the move on major occasions, including during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in 2014.  The  Chinese capital, frequently hit by smog, has teamed up with the Tianjin  municipality and Hebei province to reduce air pollution.  In  December 2015, Beijing issued a red alert for smog - the first time  since 2013. The city government put in place its emergency vehicle  formula to tackle air pollution.  According to the formula, cars  with number plates ending with two different digits are not allowed on  any week day. Thus cars with number plates ending with 1 and 6 are  restricted on one day, those ending with 2 and 7 are disallowed on  another day. All cars are allowed to ply the road on Saturdays and  Sundays.  The formula is in place from\u00a07 am to midnight.  Beijing  has said it will implement the odd-even rule on days the air quality  reaches the level of orange, the second highest alert level in China, or  is closer to the highest red level.  Besides such cars, vehicles  used to transport construction waste, tanker trucks and other heavy  trucks are also banned in the city on these days.  On days the air  quality reaches red alert level, 80 per cent of cars used by government  departments and state-owned enterprises are also ordered off Beijing\u2019s  road.  The formula does not affect six types of vehicles \u2013 police  cars, fire trucks, ambulances, engineering emergency vehicles, large  buses, taxis, and electric cars.  To tackle the difficulties of commuters, the Beijing government made elaborate arrangements.  The  Beijing metro system is one of the world\u2019s largest. It has about 18  metro lines stretching up to 527 km touching 319 stations. It is the  world's busiest in annual ridership, with 3.41 billion trips delivered  in 2014.  The odd-even scheme was also tried out in Paris in March 2014 just for a day as an experiment to tackle air pollution.  In  1989, Mexico City introduced the move and saw air pollution drop 11 per  cent. However, people soon got round the move by purchasing two cars \u2013  with odd and even numbers. It finally led to rise in air pollution.  In  Bogota, the capital of Colombia, the formula was introduced during peak  hours for two days a week.\u00a0 But it failed to have much effect as  drivers chose to drive during the non-peak hours.", "section": "Finance", "topics": {"METRO AND DEVELOPMENT": 0.42857142857142855, "ECONOMIC GROWTH": 0.2857142857142857, "GOVERNMENT, GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS": 0.14285714285714285}, "day": 1}

Ceramics are tough and are used in everything from jet engines to Formula 1 race car brakes.  Ceramics offer many appealing qualities, including high-temperature stability, environmental resistance and high strength.  But unlike polymers and some metals, ceramic particles don't fuse together when heated.  The few 3D printing techniques that have been developed for ceramics have slow production rates and involve additives that increase the material's tendency to crack.  Zak Eckel, engineer at HRL Laboratories in Malibu, California, and colleagues were able to improve upon these processes by using silicon- and oxygen-based polymers that, upon polymerisation, trap the ultra-violet (UV) light so that additives are not needed for the UV curing steps.  Once the polymer is printed, the part is heated to a high temperature to burn off the oxygen atoms, thus forming a highly dense and strong silicon carbide product.  Using electron microscopy to analyse the end product, the researchers detected no porosity or surface cracks.  Further tests reveal that the ceramic material can withstand temperatures of 1,400 degrees Celsius before experiencing cracking and shrinkage and can be fabricated into complex, curved and porous shapes.  According to the authors, these developments, which also create a more efficient ceramic-production process, hold important implications for numerous high-temperature applications, such as in hypersonic vehicles and jet engines.

Scientists have known for years that carbon dioxide (CO2) from the burning of fossil fuels has been warming the planet. The just-concluded meeting in Paris urged nations to cut their CO2 emissions to ensure that the global temperature does not rise more than 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level, while aiming for a 1.5 degree limit.  But some experts, like law professor Dan Farber of the University of California-Berkeley, doubt whether even the 2 degree goal can be achieved purely through emission cuts, suggesting other avenues must be explored.  India has indeed an additional option, some geologists believe. This consists of capturing the CO2 coming out of coal-fired power plants and injecting it below the Deccan Traps for permanent storage.  Deccan Traps - a thick pile of solidified lava from volcanic eruptions 65 million years ago - occupies about a third of peninsular India and is the world's largest continental flood-basalt province outside Siberia. The trap cover varies in thickness from a few hundred to a few thousand metres and, below this, lie thick sedimentary rocks. The idea is to pump the CO2 through the porous sedimentary rocks and use the basalt layer above as a \"cap\" to stop the gas escaping.  \"The Deccan volcanic province in India is promising and provides enough material for CO2 sequestration,\" Delhi University geologist J.P. Shrivastava, told this correspondent on the phone.  He says his laboratory studies have confirmed that CO2 reacts with calcium, magnesium and iron rich silicates in the lava, turning them into stable carbonate minerals such as calcite, dolomite, magnesite and siderite. Ramakrishna Sonde, formerly executive director of the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) had estimated that Deccan Traps might be able to hold 300,000 million tonnes of CO2 - as much as humans produce in 20 years.  Realising the potential of Deccan Traps as long-term CO2 storage option, Indian government agencies, jointly with American scientists, proposed in 2007 a field study to investigate the feasibility of this. Motivation for the project came from research at the Battelle Pacific North-West National Laboratory (PNNL) in Washington State. The US Pacific Northwest has basalt deposits similar to the Deccan Traps with an estimated holding capacity of more than 50,000 million tonnes of CO2.  The Indian study, proposed by NTPC, was to be carried out in partnership with Hyderabad's National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) and PNNL. It was one of the 17 initiatives endorsed by the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF), a 23-member voluntary climate initiative of which India was a founding member. But, according to CSLF, the Indian study has remained \"inactive\".  \"Interest on the Indian side waned after it became clear in 2009 that no binding international emissions agreements were going to happen any time soon,\" Peter McGrail of PNNL told this correspondent in an e-mail. \"I am not sure if the Paris agreement will change anything - too soon to tell,\" he added. Officials at NTPC did not reply to a query on why the study failed to take off.  While the Indian study got stuck, McGrail said \"there has been some real progress\" on small trials of CO2 injection into basalts in Iceland and another in Washington State. \"We just finished closing our CO2 injection well here this August after 1,000 tonnes of CO2 was injected in 2013,\" he said.  Shrivastava is disappointed that the govenment is giving \"very little attention\" to the vast Deccan basalt with huge potential for CO2 storage. \"Our experiments suggest Deccan Traps stands better chances (of storing CO2) compared to the Columbia river continental basalt in the US and basaltic glass of Iceland,\" he said.  Not only the Deccan Traps but other basaltic rocks such as Rajmahal Traps, Sylhet Traps, Panjal Traps and many more have to be examined, he said, adding that India would benefit by reviving the stalled study in Deccan Traps.  Former NGRI director VP Dimri agreed.  \"There is enough scope for further research in this direction,\" Dimri told this correspondent.  \"In addition to Deccan Traps basalts, the underlying sediments and older volcanics (Gujarat and western Indian offshore) can also be studied for geological sequestration of CO2,\" added Om Prakash Pandey, another NGRI scientist.  One possible way to revive the Deccan Traps study, said NGRI's chief scientist G. Parthasarathy, is to use the 1-km boreholes already drilled in Koyna for injecting CO2. The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) has, however, ruled this out. \"The boreholes were drilled for investigating reservoir-triggered seismicity in the region,\" MoES secretary M. N. Rajeevan said. \"They are unsuitable for CO2 injection studies.\"", "section": "Weather", "topics": {"WEATHER, CALAMITIES": 0.6923076923076923, "BUSINESS AND COMPANIES": 0.07692307692307693, "EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTES, ENTREPRENEURSHIPS, RESEARCH": 0.15384615384615385}, "day": 1}

Both informal and organised carpooling can be a viable option for those who don't want to get off their cars and get into a public transport bus or metro.  Taxi apps like Uber and Ola have also entered the rideshare segment. They are offering shared taxi rides within cities.  \"Odd-even policy has pumped up our registrations substantially. We are expecting to manage around 400-500 carpool trips daily. We work on a cashless system where passengers are supposed to pay online so there is no hassle of exchanging cash after each ride,\" said Honey Monga, Alliance Manager of Orahi.  Raghav Gupta, country manager at BlaBlaCar said, \"we have 25,000 seats on offer and in Delhi-NCR and this weekend onwards we expect this to go up tremendously\".  Shuttl, a bus aggregating platform offering shuttle bus service that launched this year, is also adding more buses to its existing fleet for commuters during the odd-even days.  While carpooling is being seen as a good option, there are concerns from women about how efficient the real-time service would be for regular commuters who prefer pre-planned trips.  \"The option is better than travelling in jam-packed metro train but how safe carpooling is, is a matter of concern for girls especially. Since you are travelling with strangers in a carpool, that fear will always be there at the back of our mind,\" said Swati Babber, a college student.  Nidhi Khurana, an IT professional said it will be further helpful if companies enter into some carpooling agreements with cab services for its employers.  \"Two major stakeholders - employers and government agencies can play a major role in promoting carpools. The government should frame a carpool promotion policy laying down ground rules for commercial carpools and to avoid legal or regulatory hurdles,\" she said.  \u00a0", "section": "Business", "topics": {"METRO AND DEVELOPMENT": 0.6923076923076923, "BUSINESS AND COMPANIES": 0.15384615384615385, "CRIME": 0.07692307692307693}, "day": 1}

Kejriwal  explained that there would be a reassessment after the pilot plan ends  on January 15 and that it would never be 'permanently' implemented. It  had assumed the form of a 'movement' within few hours of its  implementation from 8 am in the morning, he said.  The chief minister made the remarks after the commencement of the radical scheme,  which is aimed at mitigating spiralling air pollution levels with the  stipulation on Friday that private cars bearing odd-registration plates can  ply on city roads.  \"This will go on till January 15. Then we  will stop it and reassess. Nowehere in the world is the scheme enforced  permanently. It is practically not possible. Whenever pollution levels  spike this is used as a weapon,\" Kejriwal said.  The Chief  Minister said the restrictions may again be invoked for few days in the  next 2-3 months if pollution level sees a jump. As per initial reports,  the plan has been 'quite successful' and people in the national capital  have largely accepted the restrictions with an 'open mind', Kejriwal  said.  Under the regulations, cars bearing odd-numbered  registration plates shall ply on city roads today while those with even  number plates, if taken out, will attract a penalty of Rs 2,000 under  relevant sections of the Motor Vehicles Act.  It will be vice-versa on Saturday.  On  suggestions that cars were off roads largely for it being the first day  of the new year, Kejriwal said that most of the cars, albeit less, that  are plying bear odd number registration plates.  \"Car volume  may be less as it is a new year day but it is to be noted that most of  them have odd number registration plates. So the apprehensions are  unfounded as only car volume may go up on Monday not violations,\" he  said.  Speaking to reporters outside his residence, Kejriwal  harped on the point that the scheme will meet with success only when  people embrace it and not though force.  \"It has become a  movement and we are truly overwhelmed by the response we have received  so far. Delhi will show way to the rest of the country,\" Kejriwal said.  Deputy  Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, who reached the Secretariat on his  official car bearing odd-number registration plate, echoed the Chief  Minister's observation saying that people have adopted the initiative as  their \"own mission\".  \"And government is merely assisting them. So this is the ideal situation,\" Sisodia said.  Kejriwal  shared his car to the Secretariat with transport Minister Gopal Rai and  Health Minister Satyender Jain. They live in North Delhi's Civil Lines  area.  Tourism Minister Kapil Mishra reached the Secretariat  on his two-wheeler at around 9 AM and tweeted, \"Wow Delhi Thank you for  making #OddEvenFormula a success...just reached office on bike.. no  traffic.. Delhi is following it voluntarily.\"  Two-wheelers are included in the list of 25 categories that have been kept out of the ambit of the scheme.", "section": "Government", "topics": {"MINISTRY AND DEPARTMENTS, MINISTERS": 0.125, "METRO AND DEVELOPMENT": 0.625, "ECONOMIC GROWTH": 0.125}, "day": 1}

U give me hope that U are capable of achieving big challenges,\u201d he also wrote in a congratulatory tweet.  Kejriwal and other ministers of the Delhi government chose to follow the scheme to set an example. The chief minister carpooled with two of his ministers, Gopal Rai and Satyendra Jain, and a joint secretary to reach the Delhi Secretariat.  Tourism Minister Kapil Mishra reached the Secretariat on his two-wheeler at around 9 am and tweeted: \u201cWow Delhi Thank you for making #OddEvenFormula a success...just reached office on bike.. no traffic.. Delhi is following it voluntarily.\u201d\u00a0Two-wheelers are included in the list of 25 categories that have been kept out of the ambit of the scheme.  Former Congress MP and industrialist Naveen Jindal tweeted: \u201cAll odd number cars on road, not much traffic, taking half the time to reach places, I think it's working very well.\u201d  Around 11 am Transport Minister Gopal Rai took a bus ride to get a first-hand idea about how the odd-even scheme was getting implemented. Rai took the bus from Pragati Maidan which travelled to India Gate, Connaught Place, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg and ITO before heading back to the Delhi Secretariat.  Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said: \u201cI am very confident that Delhi people would like to give their loved ones a New Year gift, a pollution-free environment. The odd-even rule is a just a step towards this. In the last three to four days I have realised that New Delhi is ready for this rule.\u201d  Thousands of Civil Defence volunteers, traffic police personnel, enforcement teams of Delhi government's transport department and officers were deployed to implement the scheme that will stay in place till January 15.  Volunteers and officials were in action from the wee hours to monitor the implementation of the scheme. They spread across the city with rose stems in their hands, to take the \u2018Gandhigiri\u2019 route and prod the violators to follow the rule. There were indeed some violators who had to be challaned. The first violator was flagged down at around 8.30 am at ITO crossing. At Anand Vihar and Delhi Gate junction volunteers and traffic police personnel were seen requesting people to follow the rules and take their even-numbered car off the road.  At ITO crossing, Civil Defence volunteer Imran Alam said: \u201cOur main job is to help the traffic police. We are here to spread awareness among the people, if anyone is not following the odd-even rule, we will explain them the new guidelines\u201d.  A display board was installed in front of the Delhi Secretariat on which real-time figures of the suspended particulate matter --- PM2.5 and PM 10 --- were put up. At 9.30 am they read 360 and 480 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively.  \u201cToday the traffic police are not focusing on issuing challans. Priorities are vigilance and awareness. We cannot say that there were no violators on Friday, but they were few in number. People are cooperating. Some of the violators returned back when the Civil Defence volunteers requested them not to violate the odd-even scheme,\u201d transport minister Rai told  thestatesman.com .  He, however, admitted that the real test would be on January 4 (Monday) with office-goers out in full strength.\u00a0\u201cPeople must decide what should be their priority\u2026 to drive their cars or to breathe in clean air,\u201d Rai said. \u201cI believe they would cooperate on Monday too.\u201d  Later in the day Chief Minister Kejriwal said that the odd-even plan would not be implemented permanently. Kejriwal explained that there would be a reassessment after the pilot plan ends on January 15 and that it would never be \"permanently\" implemented. It had assumed the form of a \"movement\" within few hours of its implementation from 8 am in the morning, he said.  \"This will go on till January 15. Then we will stop it and reassess. Nowhere in the world is the scheme enforced permanently. It is practically not possible. Whenever pollution levels spike this will be used as a weapon,\" Kejriwal added.  The Delhi government also announced that it was conducting lung function tests at 10 different locations across the national capital. The government also said that it has proposed that trucks be allowed to enter Delhi from 11 pm onwards instead of existing 9 pm timing. \u201cTransport department has sent a proposal which favours allowing of trucks in Delhi only from 11 pm, instead of existing 9 pm,\u201d said a senior government official. As per rough estimates, around 50,000 trucks enter Delhi every day contributing to the pollution levels in the city.  Meanwhile, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) released the results of its analysis of the official air quality data from continuous monitoring by Delhi Pollution Control Committee to show how this winter pollution levels have worsened compared to last year.  In statement the CSE said: \u201cDelhi government should take this opportunity to improve the public transport services. Reduced congestion will be an opportunity to make the public transport perform more efficiently.\"  Call it the odd-even effect, by Friday evening pollution level in Delhi was down a bit in certain localities. At 5.20 pm pollution level at Mandir Marg was down at 147 micrograms per cubic metre for PM 10, and 34 micrograms per cubic metre for PM 2.5 as per the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) real-time data. However, around 7.30 pm it shot up to 367 for PM 10 and 209 for PM 2.5.  According to DPCC, at Civil Lines the PM 2.5 was at 240.98, while the PM 10 was at 237.83 micrograms per cubic metre at 5.30 pm. The date changed to 284.63 for PM 10 and 271.72 for PM 2.5 at 6.45 pm.  At RK Puram, PM 10 was 489 micrograms per cubic metre, PM 2.5 was 329 microgram per cubic metre. It shot up to 976 for PM 10 and 599 for PM 2.5 at 7.30 pm, according to DPCC data.  It was a different Central Delhi on Friday with parking lots in busy areas mostly lying vacant. The parking lots in and around Connaught Place that otherwise remain chock-a-block, wore a desolate look.  \u201cWhen I come to CP to watch a movie, I have to arrive here at least two hour ahead of the show only to find a parking space. But look here now\u2026 it\u2019s all lying vacant. I must thank Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for this,\u201d said Nutan who drove in to the Inner Circle to be pleasantly surprised.  Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Ashutosh said: \u201cWe were expecting some teething problems, but we are overwhelmed with the way people have responded. The result is beyond our expectations.\u201d  Interestingly, the AAP government\u2019s effort found support in Congress leader P Chidambaram who said: \u201cI support the odd-even plan. It\u2019s important that for short periods of time such plans must be implemented to change people\u2019s behaviour.\u201d  With the odd-even scheme operational, it is expected that several car pool applications will come handy to Delhi residents. Host of mobile applications, such as Orahi, Ibibo Ryde and BlaBlaCar, allow people to sign up and start offering or availing rides from a list of commuters going in the same direction.", "section": "Government", "topics": {"INTERNATIONAL ISSUES": 0.125, "MINISTRY AND DEPARTMENTS, MINISTERS": 0.25, "METRO AND DEVELOPMENT": 0.25, "CRIME": 0.125}, "day": 1}

Staying the single bench order, Justices Tashi Rabstan and Bansi Lal Bhat issued notices to the relevant parties returnable within four weeks after which the bench will hear the arguments on the case.  The stay order of division bench came after a petition was moved by National Secretary of BJP Farooq Khan challenging the single bench order passed by Justice Hasnain Masoodi upholding a government circular which asked all constitutional authorities to hoist the state flag with national flag atop their official buildings and vehicles.  Khan, an IPS officer and former Inspector General of Police, had contended that no flag could have the same place as that of the national tri-colour.

However, with the Kenyan hoarding declining now, tea exporters have a breather.Revenue realisation has already increased from major tea-importing counties such as Russia, Kazakhstan, the UK, Pakistan, Iran, United Arab Emirates and others. However, some countries such as the US, Germany, Egypt and others still remain on the negative side.Nevertheless, one concern is predominant \u2013 although tea export revenues are getting back to normalcy and might head towards growth, unit prices still remain in the negative territory, showing a decline of 2.84 per cent on an average.\u201cUnit prices are linked to world tea output. The situation will improve in the near future,\u201d Baheti added.The importance of tea exports stems from the fact that the costly orthodox tea, which accounts for 50 per cent of tea exports fetches the producers higher revenue in the international of Russia, Iran and the US, among others.\u201cThere are some varieties like orthodox tea which is of higher quality best suited for exports,\u201d said Sujit Patra, additional secretary of ITA.When export revenues had fallen in the previous financial year, the demand for orthodox tea remained stable.\u201cThe volume decline had majorly happened in the (crushed, tear, curl) tea variant,\u201d Patra added.Although CTC leaves dominate the Indian tea-scape, orthodox tea holds a premium thanks to its higher quality.\u201cExpertise is needed to produce the orthodox variant in Darjeeling, Assam and Nilgiris whose demand is majorly from the export market,\u201d Patra noted.The production cost of orthodox leaves is 1.5 times the standard CTC leaves, while it burns a hole in the consumer's pocket. While a kg of CTC leaves can brew 600 standard cups of tea, the same quantity of orthodox leaves can give only 250 cups. \u00a0With brighter days round the corner, the Tea Board of India has chalked out a strategy to promote tea exports. Key priorities range from developing 'single estate' and marquee brands to increase production of orthodox leaves for higher unit value to promotional activities.       "}

The previous one came in June 2011. The plant was cleared a year later but it returned on to the FDA list last September after an inspection.The Moraiya plant accounts for nearly 60 per cent of Cadila Healthcare\u2019s $500 million US business in 2014-15 and 40 per cent of pending oral solids filings. Pankaj Patel, chairperson and managing director of Cadila Healthcare, told analysts the company had discontinued production of a narrow therapeutic index drug warfarin, an anticoagulant, following an FDA inspection last September. Narrow therapeutic index drugs are have a thin dividing line between therapeutic and toxic doses.The FDA had observed deficiencies in the manufacture of warfarin and expressed concerns over Cadila Healthcare\u2019s complaint redressal mechanism. Patel said the company had hired external consultants and revised its standard operating procedures following the inspection.As for the Ahmedabad plant, Patel maintained it was not supplying any drug to the US either directly or indirectly. The unit was inspected last December.Patel indicated the company had shifted production of nine drugs from Moraiya to other locations and had initiated transfer of another four. The company expects to file for approvals for these drugs in 2016.Cadila Healthcare\u2019s plants at Baddi and Ahmedabad SEZ are certified by the FDA, from where the company can continue to export to the US.The oral oncology and oral solids formulations facility in the SEZ is yet to begin supplies to the US.\u00a0 The company has undertaken over 40 filings over the past four years from this facility.

It received final approval from the FDA to market diuretic amiloride hydrochloride tablets in the US in August.

The PM wants his team to work on innovative ideas spanning sectors that can be executed in one year, three years, and over the long term.In a 70-minute meeting with secretaries on New Year\u2019s Eve at his Race Course Road residence, Modi laid down the format through which bureaucrats must ideate. Officials told Business Standard eight groups have been formed for brainstorming. Each group will consist of eight to 10 secretaries, who will make presentations to the PM on January 12, 15 and 16.Broadly, the ideas for \u201ctransformative change\u201d must be in areas such as good governance, health, education, energy conservation, renewable energy, employment generation, inclusive growth, farmer-centric initiatives, and innovative budgeting. The NDA government\u2019s signature schemes \u2014 Swachh Bharat and Ganga rejuvenation \u2014have also been thrown up all over again for new ideas.The PM\u2019s interaction was followed by high tea, an official said. The menu included tea, juice, cutlets etc. There have been similar meetings between Modi and secretaries earlier, in a sign that the PM was looking for a direct line of contact with top civil servants. In fact, soon after taking charge, Modi had met secretaries, outlining the government agenda while assuring them that they should take decisions without any fear and that he could be contacted at any time. That was seen as a departure from the previous UPA regime under then PM Manmohan Singh, who had rarely called such meetings with all secretaries.Last November, when Modi had called secretaries for a Diwali high tea, he had asked them to \u201ccome together\u201d and \u201cwork together\u201d. Swachh Bharat was one of the big areas of discussion then as well.

As A K Tiwari, administrative head of Bansal Classes, recalls, coaching companies preferred to do what they did best, coach, and not get involved (except in a limited way) with the messy business of housing students. They also wanted to give \"Kota society\", as he calls it, a stake in the coaching sector - a stake society seems to have claimed with alacrity and not a little greed. Thus, behind the slim fa\u00e7ade of one \"Dev Residency\" teenage girls swot in 56 single rooms leading off from narrow, dark corridors, their \"warden\" a 26-year-old cousin of the owner who looks at you with blank incomprehension when you ask if there is fire evacuation plan. Sumit Chaturvedi, owner of a ritzy hotel in the heart of coaching country, and a former boarding house operator, admits cheerfully that most hostels have brazenly flouted building regulations, that virtually anyone can run them, and that the business was lucrative enough to pay for his hotel. District officials mention public health issues emanating from \"residencies\" like outbreaks of jaundice and dengue, and put the blame on lack of municipal oversight.Kota's boarding house culture means children as young as 16, none of whom go to school (they are nominally enrolled at what Kota calls \"dummy schools\" where they only show up for board exams) are required to structure their own lives after they exit from intensive six-or-seven-hour long shifts at coaching institutes. \"Kota is good if you are good\" and \"Kota can make you or break you\" are two cryptic statements Kota students often offer to explain how life in their world is a surreal blend of regimentation and perfunctory supervision.It is also a world redolent with small-town conservatism and moral preaching. Boarding house wardens, coaching institutes staff - and sometimes even students - casually criminalise heterosexual relationships in their conversations, as well as common teenage transgressions like drinking or smoking. At Allen, no less than a counsellor tells you that suicides occur, not over academic pressure, but when there is \"opposite (sex) attraction\". Posters on its premises, prepared by the same counsellor, graphically suggest that if students follow the \"right track\" of \"sacrifice, love with study, concentration, patience, respect teachers and parents\" they will get to a professional college, and if they take the \"wrong track\" of \"birthday party, cyber cafe, movies, market visit, and friendship\" they will land up back home.Such moralising and guilt-tripping almost seems to mock recent official moves to get Kota to be a kinder and gentler place. Coaching companies usually feted by officialdom for being the district's highest service tax and income tax payers, have been called to meetings in Kota and Jaipur after a stream of negative press reports over the suicides. For the first time, a Collector has circulated a note flagging, albeit in words that seem carefully chosen to not upset Kota's cash cow, invidious practices such as the streaming and shuffling of students on exam performance and the doling out of sops and incentives to high-fliers. It asks for counselling for students that is \"substantial\" not \"symbolic\", for recreation like sports and trekking, for a holiday on Sunday, for smaller class sizes.Is anyone rattled? Only a little, it seems. \"The word 'suicide' is found not only in Kota, it is found in every part of society, spreading like flu,\" says a clearly uncomfortable Naveen Maheshwari, director of Allen, attempting to explain why the bulk of the students who committed suicide were enrolled with his institute. He promises some practices will be rethought, but also asks sceptically, \"What is the link between class size and suicide?\" In similar vein, Tiwari says, \"Parents send their children here to study, not to go trekking\" and Maheshwari of Career Point asks, \"If we did not regulate ourselves, why would people keep coming to us?\" It will clearly take more than a few tragic deaths for Kota's coaching empires to lose faith in the efficacy of their business model.

For all standard loans, banks make a provision of 0.4 per cent. This would mean banks will hike their final lending rates, too, to take care of the provision. They would also not readily lend at a time when they are struggling with capital.\"Banks shall make additional provision of two per cent\u2026 against standard assets representing all exposures to the step-down subsidiaries, to cover the additional risk arising from complexity in the structure, location of different intermediary entities in different jurisdictions exposing the Indian company, and hence the bank, to greater political and regulatory risk,\" said in a notification on its website.A step-down subsidiary is a subsidiary of a subsidiary. Companies float special purpose vehicles (SPV) for specific projects and these SPVs are usually step-down subsidiary of the main subsidiary.While there is no bar on giving such loans, both funded and on a non-fund basis, the Indian parent should hold at least 51 per cent in the direct subsidiary and the step-down subsidiary's control should be in the hands of the Indian promoters, RBI said. \"This is negative for banks having high overseas loan book.

Among PSU banks, Bank of Baroda, and Bank of India have the highest overseas loans (about one-third of total loans),\" said Parag Jariwala, vice-president, institutional research, banking and financial services, Religare Capital Markets.To aid companies to raise foreign money without risk to the country, RBI recently allowed Indian companies to raise rupee resources from foreign investors directly. However, for foreign operations, companies are still mostly dependent on banks. Most of the time Indian banks these companies or provide a line of credit for these operations.According to an analyst with a domestic brokerage, this provision will have significant impact for banks. \"Typically, 60-70 per cent of the international loans are given to step-down subsidiaries and SPVs. If banks have to make provisions against them, it would be a significant number,\" said the analyst requesting anonymity."}

An overwhelming majority of the chief executive officers (CEOs) polled by Business Standard say they plan to invest more, as they expect to come down and the pace of reforms to pick up with roll-out of a national goods and services tax (GST). The poll, to gauge the mood of corporate India and its plans for the New Year, was conducted among 50 across India in the first fortnight of December.Corporate earnings, which have remained muted in the past few quarters, are expected to improve in 2016, say 68 per cent of the CEOs polled. They add this will mainly be fuelled by fresh government orders, low tax rates coming into effect from April 1, and spending. For many infrastructure projects, the CEOs say, a ramp-up that has already begun will give a fillip to steel, cement and construction companies. While nearly half the CEOs polled are not happy with the pace of economic reforms so far under the current government, 60 per cent agree that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious development agenda has been hijacked by fringe elements. The government struggled with its inclusive agenda in 2015, as several members of Parliament from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party made inflammatory statements against minority communities. This affected investors' confidence in India and sullied the Modi government's image during the crucial Bihar election.Almost 60 per cent of the CEOs say they want the government to remove all restrictions on foreign direct investments (FDI), including those in single-brand retail and defence. This, they say, will bring fresh investments and create new jobs in the country.With the cap on in insurance being raised to 49 per cent in 2015, many Indian companies sold their stakes at good valuations to their joint venture partners.The top item on the CEOs' wish list for the New Year is on expected lines. They want to see the economy moving on to the fast track.The rollout, investment in public infrastructure, and low interest rates will be key to their investment plans, they say. The GST Bill seeks to cut multiplicity of taxes; it will subsume several central and state taxes, significantly improve tax revenues over a period, and reduce the paperwork for the companies.\"The government's top priority in the New Year should be infrastructure revival, by kick-starting the stalled projects. This will help boost confidence of the investors. It will also facilitate reduction of banks' bad loans and increase spending - by the government as well as private players,\" says a large company's CEO, who doesn't wish to be named.Asked about the biggest risks of 2016, the CEOs say the economy will be hit hard if the commodity cycle picks up in the New Year.In 2015, the economy benefited from billions of dollars that were saved on account of low prices of crude oil, India's biggest import item. Rising pollution levels in the metro cities, land acquisition delays for new industrial projects, and volatility in the value of the rupee are also seen as risks to the economy.\"There could be a big risk if economic growth does not take place as expected, and the turmoil in West Asia intensifies,\" says T V Narendran, managing director of Tata Steel India and South Asia.The Modi government took several steps in 2015 to ease the process for awarding projects and improving attractiveness of infrastructure projects, but CEOs say much remains to be done. The government-approved rationalised compensation to road developers for project delays and segregation of civil and capital costs would help, they say. This will not only revive the stalled projects but also encourage banks and concessionaires to lend more. Besides, separating civil construction cost from capital cost will help the government meet its target of awarding 10,000 km of road projects by March 2016.As regards the stock market, which fell nearly five per cent in 2015, CEOs say it will continue to remain flattish in the New Year; 48 per cent of the respondents expect the BSE Sensex to stay below the 30,000 mark at the end 2016. While 12 per cent of the CEOs are non-committal on the Sensex target, the rest say they expect the benchmark index to breach the 30,000 mark by the end of 2016.       "}

According to the company, the portal has seen an increase in demands of both food and non-food FMCG items. Skin care products from such as Olay, Nivea, homecare products from companies such as P&G, Hindustan Unilever and Reckitt Benckiser are drawing maximum sales.However, Taneja said the firm would not get directly involved in the hyperlocal grocery segment. \"What we are offering is a wider assortment of products at great prices and the consumers who are buying from us are ready to wait for at least two days to get their products delivered,\" added Taneja.Snapdeal, in September 2015, invested in PepperTap, an on-demand hyperlocal grocery delivery service, along with existing investors Sequoia India and SAIF Partners. Next year, Snapdeal plans to integrate PepperTap's services on its platform. \"The integration will happen, but when, we will have to see,\" Taneja said.After the re-launch of Maggi noodles on Snapdeal, the company plans to continue the trend and go for more such big bang product launches next year.

Also, FMCG companies want to launch a number of products on our platform that are available in other countries, but not in India,\" said Taneja.The other verticals which have witnessed a rise in demand on Snapdeal are child care, and women's fashion.

Janus, the two-faced Roman god of transitions, looks with one face to the past, and with the other to the future. 2015 was so rocky for most people that 2016 seems like a better view.So, as the planet\u2019s axis tilts again, and the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn prepare for another slow seesaw; as the earth sets off on one more long rotation around the sun; as sea levels rise, and flood and drought and earthquake punctuate the rhythm of life, it\u2019s time to reflect on the fundamental question for the future, and that is: Donald Trump? Really?Yes, this could be the year that the most clownish of an uninspiring pack of US Republican presidential candidates gives the Democratic party a serious run for its money. Many Americans, and most of the rest of the world, wants to believe that Mr Trump couldn\u2019t possibly clinch the Republican nomination, let alone become POTUS, and hopefully he won\u2019t \u2014 but the world is crazy enough that one should never say never.It may be that America really decides to put its faith in a man who thinks that the solution to gun violence is more guns, wants to raise anti-immigration walls that would have kept his own parents out of America, references a debate moderator\u2019s menstrual cycle, and has a disturbingly orange cast to his skin. (He also constantly picks on other people\u2019s physical attributes, so he\u2019s fair game for a cheap shot.) Some people think of The Donald as the Democrats\u2019 secret weapon, a subtle saboteur working for Hillary Clinton. Alas, I don\u2019t think you can be that rich \u2014 or that orange \u2014 without trimming your sails to your own winds.Please, America, do not unleash this chap on the world. You\u2019ve already given us ISIS \u2014 yes, you did that \u2014 ISIS, who are probably celebrating the newly dawned year 1372 with a little beheading practice. Have mercy. I realise this is rich coming from a country that gave the world Sakshi \u2018Ten Hindu Kids\u2019 Maharaj and Baba \u2018Gay Cure Yoga\u2019 Ramdev. But at least our nutjobs don\u2019t have their fingers on the big red button. (Arguably.) Anyway, that\u2019s my first wish for the world for the coming year: may the Trump campaign collapse in a cloud of dust.I have many wishes for India, but the dearest is that we should start to fix two critical training and employment areas: the one that produces schoolteachers, and the one that produces health care professionals \u2014 physicians, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and administrators.The abysmal quality of our government schoolrooms is producing slightly, and badly, educated young people who will become a poor quality workforce \u2014 at worst it doesn\u2019t educate them at all, and at best doesn\u2019t do justice to their potential. You can make all kinds of shining smart cities, but if they\u2019re run by dull people, you may as well have saved the money.We have some of the finest doctors in the world, but we also have some of the most badly trained and dangerous doctors, who buy and cheat their way to a medical degree and who play with people\u2019s lives every time they wake up in the morning. We have some of the most accessible and affordable pharmaceutical products in the world, but also racketeers who put spurious tablets in the hands of vulnerable sick people, at best not improving their condition, and at worst killing them.If we can block the route to fake degrees, and focus on creating actual training systems \u2014 well-trained people who can train others well after them \u2014 we will at least be on the way to creating two solid fundamental systems that make people\u2019s lives better, and that contribute to the much-vaunted economy instead of impeding it.There, that\u2019s not too much to ask for, I don\u2019t think. We cannot get anywhere, let alone where we want to go, unless we fix these two things. If we don\u2019t, we will have a small set of great \u2014 or lucky \u2014 individuals and businesses pulling ahead, but the vast majority of India will be left shambling behind, trying to fend for itself as best it can.That\u2019s not sabka saath, sabka vikas. Of course I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s reasonable to expect a focus on top-notch education from a central government that has done everything short of tattooing the word \u2018anti-intellectual\u2019 on its own forehead, but this is the thing about every new year: one can hope. Happy 2016.       "}

An earlier plea by Bhangoo, one of the main promoters of the PACL group, which includes companies like Pearls Agrotech Corp and Pearls Golden Forest (PGFL), is already pending before SAT.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Facing heat from multiple agencies in the country's biggest illegal fund-mobilisation case, Bhangoo had moved SAT on December 30 against Sebi's recovery proceedings to collect funds due to investors.A single-member bench had listed the matter for today, as the Presiding Officer of the Tribunal was on vacation.In today's proceedings, the Tribunal refused to grant any immediate stay sought by Bhangoo and listed the matter for hearing on January 29.Earlier this week, PACL had also filed a writ petition before the Delhi High Court seeking a stay on Sebi's recovery proceedings which the regulator initiated earlier last month against PACL, Bhangoo and others to recover funds totalling more than Rs 60,000 crore that they were asked to refund to investors.While PACL is being probed by multiple agencies including CBI and ED, found it to have collected money from crores of investors through unauthorised collective investment schemes in the name of real estate projects. It is also said to have been involved in agriculture land related schemes.The mobilisation of funds date back to 1990s.However, the court has not granted any stay and the matter is likely to be heard further next month.Interestingly, SAT has previously rejected a plea by PACL against Sebi's earlier refund order asking the company and its promoters and directors to refund Rs 49,100 crore along with applicable returns and interest to the investors.The company had also approached Supreme Court, which has not granted any stay on the matter. After hearing another plea earlier in 2013, the apex court had directed Sebi to probe the matter involving PACL's fund-collection schemes and take appropriate actions.Last month, the government had said that instructions have also been issued to Registrar of Companies to file prosecutions against PACL for non-compliance of provisions of the and accounting standards.Replying to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha had said that the government had received various complaints with regard to collection of deposits by PACL India alleging non-payment of amounts advanced to the company for purchase of land, money laundering and non-settlement of accounts in respect to transfer of land.On December 15, capital regulator Sebi orderedattachment of all bank and demat accounts of PACL Ltd and its nine promoters and directors for failure to refund more than Rs 60,000 crore due to investors.PACL had raised Rs 49,100 crore from nearly 5 crore investors that it needs to refund along with promised returns, interest payout and other charges, which take the total amount due to more than Rs 55,000 crore, as per Sebi's order.Besides, PACL has another group firm PGFL which has \"illegally mobilised more than Rs 5,000 crore and failed to refund the same in spite of directions of Sebi and SAT\", the regulator had said while initiating the recovery proceedings.The proceedings were initiated against PACL Ltd, as also its promoters and directors -- Tarlochan Singh, Sukhdev Singh, Gurmeet Singh, Subrata Bhattacharya, Nirmal Singh Bhangoo, Tyger Joginder, Gurnam Singh, Anand Gurwant Singh and Uppal Devinder Kumar.Sebi had asked them to refund the money in an order dated August 22, 2014. The defaulters were directed to wind up the schemes, and refund money to the investors within a period of three months from the date of the order.Sebi also filed criminal complaints before Tis Hazari Court on November 17, 2015 against the company and its directors. The mobilisation of funds by PACL Ltd traces back to 1990s.Upon receipt of a complaint, Sebi had first issued letters in November-December 1999 to PACL, advising it to comply with the provisions of the Sebi's CIS Regulations dealing with Collective Investment Schemes.PACL challenged the letters before the High Court of Rajasthan, claiming that its scheme does not fall under the definition of CIS. PACL had also challenged the constitutional validity of the CIS Regulations.The Court in its order dated November 28, 2003 held that PACL's schemes were not CIS as defined under Sebi rules and quashed Sebi's directive to PACL.However, Sebi appealed before the Supreme Court, which in an order dated February 26, 2013 upheld the constitutional validity of CIS Regulations, and directed Sebi to investigate the matter and take appropriate actions.After conducting further inquiry, Sebi passed the order dated August 22, 2014, wherein, inter-alia, PACL, its promoters and directors were directed to wind up all the existing CIS of PACL Limited and refund the monies returns which are due to its investors.PACL had again approached SAT against Sebi's order of August last year. The Tribunal however dismissed the appeal on August 12 this year and directed the defaulters to refund the money within a period of three months.       "}

Windowless and minimally decorated, this room in the business centre looks like it could double as the set for an interrogation room used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the TV series Homeland. Mishra, who has just flown in from Mumbai and has a speech to give at the hotel on the power generation industry immediately after our lunch, is huddled over his smartphone. He looks utterly preoccupied. None of this seems like a good omen for a discursive, leisurely lunch.First impressions prove to be misleading, however. Mishra\u2019s answer to my first question about the move towards a low-carbon world being more talked about than realised is akin to flicking a switch that bathes the gloomy room in bright light. On the one hand, there is pressure for the lowest tariffs among governments, Mishra says. On the other, a big push for renewables. We are speaking a couple of weeks before the climate change conference in Paris. \u201cGovernments around the world are not quite making up their minds on how to (manage) the transition to a decarbonising world,\u201d says Mishra. Policy is caught in what he describes as \u201cthe energy trilemma\u201d: ensuring low costs for the consumer, a focus on reducing emissions and ensuring competition. He points to the Chinese turbine manufacturer CLP buys its power turbines from for its coal-fired plant in Jhajjar, Haryana, which actually saw sales fall in 2014 as China rapidly moves towards using cleaner sources of energy. Alongside this enormous change, people are also looking at what might disrupt the business. \u201cInternationally, people are asking, \u2018Who is going to be the Uber of power and change the model?\u2019\u201dBeing a company with its headquarters in Hong Kong, CLP saw early that the pollution caused by China\u2019s rush for industrial growth would lead inevitably to demands for cleaner electricity. In 2007, CLP \u2014 which is one-third owned by the Kadoorie family and has no mainland Chinese ownership \u2014 laid out carbon dioxide emission reduction targets for 2050, revising them in 2010 to reduce carbon intensity to 0.2 kg CO2 for every kilowatt hour by 2050, a steep drop from 0.84 kg CO2 per kilowatt hour in 2007.In 2015, India itself became a fervent convert to the cause of wind and solar power, setting incredible targets that, if achieved, would be the subject of modern-day mythology. The target for solar power, for instance, is to jump from an installed capacity of 4,000 Mw in 2015 to 100,000 Mw by 2022. Neither China nor Germany, world leaders in this arena and industrial behemoths, have come close to such an increase.The company is still figuring out whether money can be made as bids ratchet downwards to seemingly uneconomic levels. SunEdison\u2019s bid of a historically low tariff of Rs 4.63 per unit of power to secure a 500Mw solar power park in Andhra Pradesh has rattled many in the industry. \u201cWe obviously have to do it at a level that makes sense to our shareholders,\u201d Mishra says. Then, in a classic Mishra riff, this unusually forthright managing director has much more to say on this. Some months ago, Mishra told The Financial Express that the absurdly low coal block auction bids by power and infrastructure companies were akin to \u201ccompanies trying to commit suicide\u2026 if you keep trying, you will succeed eventually.\u201d Why pricing is so low is the \u201ctrillion dollar question\u201d, he tells me. \u201cCompetitive (bidding) in India often results in irrational exuberance.\u201d Then, he points to the fact that power producers for solar power in China are being paid a good bit more. Given that China is the world\u2019s most competitive exporter of solar panels \u2014 one can even buy them off Alibaba.com \u2014 it seems implausible that producers in India could guarantee a lower tariff.\u201cExactly where is this competitive advantage coming from,\u201d he asks rhetorically. \u201cOur ease, or rather unease, of doing business is higher. Our construction periods are longer. How come tariffs are less?\u201d Mishra says that it will be a year or so before we find out if these bids are commercially viable because banks will either finance them or balk at doing so. \u201cOne must have the humility to figure this out. It would be stupid to say, \u2018We are the only wise guys in the room\u2019.\u201d A few years ago, CLP chose not to bid for the tautologically named ultra mega power projects in India, deciding wisely that they were too risky. Of the 16 4,000 Mw plants planned, only four were awarded and just two are operational.Mishra is philosophically solidly behind the push to renewables and lowering emission levels from coal and gas plants. But, he worries that in India, the \u201cconcern for lower tariffs crowds out everything else\u201d. I say that when I lived in Beijing, pollution levels were always being discussed on social media, but until very recently, this seemed much less of an issue among the population in India than it was in autocratic China. \u201cYou have just defined why I don\u2019t make five-year forecasts in India,\u201d he jokes in response before turning serious. \u201cI am also an Indian and a father and I often wonder why\u2026 The popular narrative is \u2018how much are the power generators fleecing consumers\u2019.\u201d In Jhajjar, he says, 75 per cent of the tariff paid to CLP India is in effect a payment to Coal India and the Indian Railways.I had heard from a friend in Hong Kong that Mishra often arrives in the city with detailed shopping lists for his children. I ask him about this and he immediately shows me a photograph of his son and daughter who are 17 and 13. Half of his daughter\u2019s requests are various kinds of health foods because she is a vegan. One request was for \u201cnutritional yeast which is stuck in customs in Mumbai\u201d even after he had responded to a five-page questionnaire.At this point, I am not only hungry, but concerned that the food order has been similarly lost in transit between the business centre and the hotel\u2019s restaurants. But, minutes after I ask about this apologetically, pizzas and buffalo mozzarella with tomato arrives. There is also rigatoni with meat and a zingy arrabiata. We discuss Mishra\u2019s passion for running marathons. In 2014, he did a full marathon in Slovenia. \u201cOver the years, we have come to love old Europe, especially Eastern Europe because it is unexplored. We always drive.\u201dBack in Mumbai, the family has particular views on how to spend weekends in and out of the city. Mishra does not check emails on the weekend. Moreover, \u201cwhen all four of us go out, no one is allowed to carry a phone. Time-out means time-out\u201d. This seems a model approach to a work-life balance.The conversation returns to the brave new world for renewables. In India, the push to produce clean energy may collide head-on with the need for state electricity boards to become financially viable and a resulting reluctance on their part to buy electricity because they lose money selling it at subsidised rates. If you are losing 60 to 70 paise for every unit of power, \u201cthe rational response is not to sell\u201d, he says. CLP has a large wind plant in Tamil Nadu, where wind power benefits from two monsoons, but often just when the company\u2019s wind unit is producing the most, it is unable to sell on to the grid. Other states claim \u201cgrid emergencies\u201d and decline to buy, he reports. Some states have renewable purchase obligations, but \u201cnot a single state has been penalised\u201d. \u201cDo you have the right signals in the regulatory structure,\u201d Mishra asks. That has been the perennial question in the electricity sector for two decades now. Waiting for the answer may make the youthful Mishra (and others in the power sector) turn grey. Time\u2019s up and before I am out the door, Mishra is working on his emails again. CLP\u2019s marathon man appears to have the stamina to navigate this arduous journey.       "}

In doing so, it had failed to exercise due skill and care in conduct of business, breaching the statutory requirements under the Sebi Act.The order said Sebi had examined the period from April 2012 to January 2014, when there were 21,198 instances amounting to Rs 220 crore of transfer of funds between the notice client \u2018s account and Anand Rathi Commodities.

Every senior railway-person I meet seems to know of Shooter. I must confess I was ignorant. I had no idea he had a distinguished career (in various capacities) with the railways in Britain and was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year Honours List of 2010 for his services to the rail industry. Let me explain how and why I met Shooter.Three of India's mountain railways have obtained World Heritage status from the Unesco. Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR) got this status in 1999, Nilgiri Mountain Railway (NMR) in 2005 and Kalka-Shimla Railway (KSR) in 2008. An attempt from Matheran Hill Railway (MHR) for World Heritage status has been pending with the Unesco (the 2009 application failed and a new one is being processed). Two of these railways - Darjeeling and Matheran - are two feet narrow gauge. DHR was constructed in 1881 - it is the oldest of the mountain railways - and MHR in 1907. The rolling stock, including locomotives, is interchangeable between Darjeeling and Matheran. KSR, constructed in 1903, is narrow gauge with two and a half feet. NMR, constructed in 1908, is metre gauge and has a unique technology known as rack and pinion, which people come from around the world to see.Originally, all these railways were run on steam engines. Using steam locomotives is a condition for obtaining and retaining the World Heritage status. But Indian Railways (IR) no longer uses steam locomotives for trains that are time-tabled. The last time a time-tabled passenger train used steam locomotives was in Wankaner in Gujarat, in 2000. No one makes steam locomotives in India now. Chittaranjan Locomotive Works stopped producing steam locomotives in 1973 (that was broad gauge). Steam is no longer used because it is more expensive than diesel and electricity. The requirement of using steam traction to retain the World Heritage status is ensured through steam charters. That is, steam locomotives are used if one specially pays for them, or for joy-rides. Normal passenger trains on the mountain railways have diesel engines. This is despite tourists, especially foreign tourists who are fascinated by steam engines, willing to pay a premium for riding on steam trains. Tour operators say there is such a high-end market and are even willing to run private charter trains. The problem is that such niche heritage markets are not important for IR. It doesn't market them. Although a World Heritage status from the Unesco doesn't legally require a separate management entity, such a separate management entity is desirable, de-linked from IR. It can be called the Indian Heritage Railway Corporation, with some equity from IR, and can be in charge of all mountain railways. However, there should be no subsidies from IR. The three mountain railways must become profit-making entities.Once this is done, one can run trains on steam locomotives. Getting steam engines is a problem. They are not made in India any longer and there are few global producers. Each locomotive will also cost around Rs 2.5 crore. But there are steam locomotives that are still somewhere and these can be restored and reused. Getting a list is easier for mountain railways like DHR, whose fan club associations are more active. Out of 34 steam locomotives built for DHR, it still possesses 11, although only five are in working condition. The other six locomotives can be restored. The ones not with DHR are in different places - National Rail Museum, Tipong Colliery (North Eastern Coalfields), Tindharia Works, Dehradun railway station (plinthed), Lucknow railway station (plinthed), Rail Bhavan (plinthed), various workshops and divisional railway manager offices. Plinthed means they are on top of pedestals. They can be brought back into action. The ones in Tipong Colliery are used to haul coal. Only one DHR locomotive was taken out of the country. That went to an American museum (where it ran on Hesston Steam Railway) and now runs on a private steam railway, Beeches Light Railway, in Britain.That's how I chanced upon the name Adrian Shooter. He bought that DHR locomotive from the US in 2002 and restored it. He also owns Beeches Light Railway. Indeed, it operates out of his residence in Steeple Aston, Oxfordshire. That's how Darjeeling Himalayan \"B\" class locomotive number 778 (originally numbered 19) became Shooter's property. (\"B\" class engines were a staple in DHR. Earlier designs didn't work that well. You will recognise a \"B\" class from water tanks on the boiler.) Having got the name, I asked Mark Tully if he knew Shooter. He certainly did. Tully knows everyone. He e-introduced us and the three of us had lunch together. I had visions of Shooter returning the engine, like the Koh-i-Noor, to the rightful owner. He dug out his phone and, with great affection and care written all over his face, showed me pictures of number 778 running on his estate, painted blue and puffing away. Frankly, it is better off where it is. Even if Shooter agrees to return it, IR is not ready. Our sacred texts say donations must never be made to unworthy recipients."}

The beginning of a new year only gives us a handy excuse to lean back, and look ahead. Let's begin with our newspaper pages and prime time debates as we step into 2016.The biggest story is Delhi's odd-even car rationing plan. I am among those who remain doubtful that this band-aid can be a lasting solution in a country which still has very poor car-to-population ratios and without addressing socio-agricultural practices and fuel-policy distortions that lie at the root of our smog crisis. But the scheme has found wide popular support. The quality of air we breathe is now among the foremost concerns on our minds.Next, our opinion space is dominated by what could, in the past, have been a totally esoteric debate on Net neutrality. This, of course, after a week of our multiple front-pages showcasing Facebook's Free Basics offer. In a society obsessed with party politics, identity issues and those of basic needs, would you have ever imagined a hundred crores-worth of front-page advertising \"selling\" a disruptive new internet service, for free?Is India going nuts? Can air-quality and internet democracy be among our foremost concerns as we step into what is, after all, just another year? Have the issues of roti, kapda or makaan; caste, religion or language; bijli, sadak or padhayi; corruption and misgovernance, all receded?They haven't. But as we break out of a past weighed down by concerns of survival into a future of opportunity, our political concerns are also moving up the value chain.An assertion like this can always be countered with reports of the drought-hit in Bundelkhand eating rotis made of grass, or farmers' suicides. But similar arguments confronted my reckless belief in the summer of 2009 that India was moving from a politics of grievance to aspiration. Better air quality and internet democracy are only a logical step in that new urge - better health care and quality of food may be next.Climate change was esoteric until a couple of years ago. But today, with better awareness, spread of the media and internet connectivity, it isn't so. Farmers and fishermen have been feeling the impact of climate change as much as have our cities, Chennai being the latest. In Punjab, cotton was hit by white flies (a pest of citrus) this year, as delayed and patchy rains denied the farmer the weeks of drenching that would have drowned the larvae between crops. Our foremost farm economist Ashok Gulati notes that we have just seen only our second instance of consecutive monsoon failures in 110 years, and while it is most unlikely that there will be a third, he is no longer so sure: \"Who is to know after what has happened in Chennai?\" The fishermen have seen their catchments move - one reason our fishermen are being caught more often in Pakistani waters along the Gujarat coast is that they are forced to go longer distances chasing shifting schools of Red Snapper. Just as we city folk are becoming conscious of our air quality, the farmer and the fisherman too understand that some of the natural adversity is man-made.India is a unique large democracy where, from the extreme Luddite Left to the Saffron Right, there are no climate-change deniers. Climate change, environment and air quality, therefore, are joining the key agenda items in politics and it will force our governments to shift policies. The Centre, for example, can no longer postpone fuel price and power reforms to protect our air and water resources. If the farmer gets free power for irrigation - but only six hours a day and that too unpredictably late night, the inclination is to leave the tubewell switched on. Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have had to concede his agriculture portfolio to an RSS appointee obsessed with \"jaivik kheti\" (organic farming), cow dung and urine, but he will have to modernise, or the farmer will punish him. There is a new urgency, therefore, for fertiliser price reform to reverse nutrition imbalance, and unshackling seed research now smothered by technophobes of the Nagpur Right as much as it was by those of the NAC Left under the UPA. More efficient and prudent use of land, water and air is now becoming a factor in our politics as well.Mr Modi himself was the quickest off the blocks learning to promise a Digital India. But connectivity is to digitisation what irrigation is to farming. One of the most devastating arguments used against the BJP by Nitish Kumar in the Bihar elections was call-drops, or deteriorating connectivity. Many BJP campaigners had then laughed this away as a give-them-cake proposition in India's poorest large state. But Bihar too has seen a spread of cheap smartphones and poor connectivity: dropped calls, while charges for data keep going higher and higher, are now an issue of quality of life, as well as inflation. That is why Mark Zuckerberg has waded into India with his \"freebie\" offer.A population that worries about its air and water quality and internet democracy will not take long asking more serious questions on the quality of health care it gets from the government and the private sector, and the price at which it comes. A new wave of resentment will soon build over the quality of education that an entire generation of Indians is getting at our declining public universities and our sub-standard private engineering and management colleges. Going ahead, politics and voter choices will be determined not so much by whether you are for or against Macaulay or whether Aurangzeb was a tyrant or a much-misunderstood Mughal, but by how employable you are with a degree which your parents sold their lands for you to acquire. Even on food, inflationary patterns indicate a qualitative surge: pulses, meat, milk, eggs, vegetables and fruits have all risen while grains stagnate as more people look for proteins and micro-nutrients. The quality and safety of food are emerging as new concerns too.Sadly, our Parliament has remained frozen for an entire year. So, to some extent, has our government been. But public discourse has been moving, evolving and, yes, I say once again, moving up the value chain. That is why the BJP concern for the cow leaves our voters as unimpressed as Congress complaining of curtailment of doles. It's a bit like when you are stalled on the expressway and objects in the rear-view mirror are rushing in closer. My new year wish, therefore, is reasonable: it's about time we moved on."}

We will know soon enough whether this delivers path-breaking thoughts, but don't bet on it. Bureaucrats are trained to follow rules and precedents; most of them are administrators, not problem-solving managers. That is why new ideas usually come from politicians, technocrats and civil society activists - like Annadurai's subsidised rice scheme, MGR's mid-day meals, Rajiv Gandhi's technology missions, Nandan Nilekani's 'Aadhaar' programme, and Aruna Roy's right to information campaign. Also, senior bureaucrats are usually very overworked people, and therefore unable to sit back and think of new ideas. But eight groups have been constituted, and they have been tasked with suggesting new ideas. So, for all one knows, the government's departmental secretaries might surprise the sceptics.Nevertheless, Mr Modi might find it fruitful to spare some time to look for ideas in the world of books. A well-wisher could therefore do worse than to send the prime minister a New Year gift of half a dozen books that he could read, and even re-read. By far the most important book to include in such a gift parcel would be Why Nations Fail by Daron Acemoglu and James A Robinson. This well-known work underlines the fundamental point that the difference between successful and not-so-successful countries is the quality of their institutions. Traditionally, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has tended to focus on selecting its favourite sons (and to some extent daughters) for key posts, giving less, if any, attention to the business of strengthening institutions. The Modi government has followed this pattern. All the more reason why it is important for the prime minister to internalise the fundamental importance of well-functioning institutions for shaping our future.The next most important book that Mr Modi could be offered is Poor Economics by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo. India's primary failings have been in its inability to deliver health and education for all; quite a few poorer countries have done better. It is important for the prime minister (and others) to understand why, and the easily digestible work by Banerjee-Duflo provides many answers. A third book which should be easily available to Mr Modi, because one of its authors is the vice-chairman of NITI Aayog, is Why Growth Matters - authored by Jagdish Bhagwati and Arvind Panagariya. Far too many Indian politicians underestimate the fundamental truth of that book's title - more of them are in the Congress, Socialist and Communist parties than in the BJP, but even the BJP is not sufficiently seized with the centrality of the idea (backed by multi-country experience) that the most important way to erase poverty is to ensure rapid economic growth. To be sure, there is the issue of growing inequality, and very real concerns regarding those at the bottom of the pyramid. A companion volume therefore should be An Uncertain Glory by Jean Dreze and Amartya Sen. But I would venture to suggest that the Bhagwati-Panagariya volume would be more useful just now, especially since it debunks quite a few myths that have struck root in mainstream Indian thinking.No one would be surprised by these mainstream book choices. A newly-published book that should be to Mr Modi's taste is Rebooting India: Realising a Billion Aspirations. The authors, Nandan Nilekani and Viral Shah, look at how best to tackle a dozen specific issues, covering a broad range, by using technology and organisational initiatives. Finally, since Mr Modi is about to launch his government's start-up initiative in a couple of weeks, he might do well to read a freshly minted, clear-eyed book on the subject: The Golden Tap: The Inside Story of Hyper-Funded Indian Start-Ups by Kashyap Deorah. Even for a hyper-busy prime minister who does not take any time off, these half-dozen books should not take more than a couple of weeks to absorb. It may be time better spent than waiting for new ideas from civil servants.       "}

As always, however, I find myself drawn to new takes on time-worn traditions; novel ways of looking at the same old things that we've been seeing year after year. Earlier this week, when I was stuck in Mumbai's slow-moving traffic with cabbie Laxman Prasad of Zila Phoolpur, Allahabad, he showed me how it's possible to discover new meanings in old ways - if one chooses to imagine them differently.It all began when I commented that the cab smelled of the familiar charred aroma of chokha, the garlicky brinjal dish so beloved across the Indo-Gangetic Plain. \"Nobody makes chokha the way my mother does,\" he said. \"She slow-roasts the brinjal studded with chilli and garlic over burning cow-dung cakes.\" Sensing a simpatico ear and seeing the traffic grind to a halt, he settled down to telling me his life story. \"My father died when my two brothers and I were young. He made us pledge on his deathbed that we'd always stay united. And here we are, 20 years after his death, all married with children but still in a joint family,\" he narrated. He lived in a chawl in Ghatkopar and plied two taxis in Mumbai. The chokha smelled too strong for me to think of much else. How did his mother manage to roast brinjals over cow-dung cakes in a crowded chawl, I asked curiously. \"She doesn't live in Mumbai,\" he said. \"I returned yesterday from the village and carried it with me.\" I was confused. Didn't he tell me he lived in a joint family with his mother and brothers? \"I do, of course, but it is a different type of joint family,\" he said.It turned out that Prasad had lived with his nuclear family and an ever-changing corpus of brothers, cousins and nephews in Mumbai for the last 20 years, while the rest of the family lived in Allahabad. \"Like many others, I was compelled to migrate when my family needed cash. But because we were restricted by the promise we'd made to our dying father, my mother said I could go on the condition that I contributed every penny I earned to the household - just as I'd have done if we had lived together,\" he said. Since then, every month, he kept only his living expenses and sent home everything else. \"Also, like other joint family homes, mine too is open to all family members who work in Mumbai. Currently, my brother's sons are living here and driving our other taxi.\"This novel \"joint family\" arrangement had worked well for them financially. \"The family land gives us all the food we need. And the money we've collectively earned in these two decades has enabled us to buy two more taxis in Allahabad, which my brothers operate,\" he said. \"Today, all our children study in good schools, wear good clothes and eat well, thanks to this consolidation of family earnings. Most importantly, since we don't always share a roof, the women of the family haven't had the opportunity to fight - the single reason why so many traditional joint families break apart.\" In their village, he said proudly, Prasad's family was known for its unity.\"Had we remained 'joint' in the formal sense of the word, we'd all have been either poor in Phoolpur, or poor in Ghatkopar,\" he said as we neared my destination. Thanks to this practical redefinition of the joint family structure, Prasad and his brothers had actually made tradition work for them. As I paid him, he looked ruefully at his tiffin box, \"I miss her fresh chokha though.\"       "}

Authorities reported a footfall of 15,000 in one day alone. The long Christmas weekend coupled with beautiful, sunny days in the winter made Jaipur the perfect getaway from the polluted air in the national capital.With its history, classic architecture, good infrastructure, welcoming attitude and superb food, Jaipur continues to be an important tourist destination. The Delhi-Agra-Jaipur triangle is a favourite with foreign tourists as well.While its history and palaces continue to hold fort as the biggest tourist attractions, it is Jaipur's delectable food that really makes one swoon. It requires a huge appetite and loads of time to be able to sample what is on offer in its various corners.From breakfast at one of the lassi shops on Mirza Ismail Road to a visit to Rawat Mishthan Bhandar for the pyaaz or mawa kachori, kadha doodh and jalebi, to paying obeisance at the legendary Laxmi Mishthan Bhandar, Jaipur can make you beg for a bigger appetite - because you may also want to try the dal baati choorma or the classic Rajasthani thali with numerous small portions of local delicacies. Non-vegetarians need not despair, for there is Handi with its lal maans and tandoori chicken that can keep them satiated. You could also go to Virasat or Chokhi Dhani for a traditional Rajasthani experience. Both are designed to satisfy the tourists' craving to get photographed in a typical Rajasthani mileu. At Virasat, there is even a throne where you can sit wearing a safa and get clicked. You marvel at the acumen of the owners of the place for having thought it up while wide-eyed tourists get clicked around you.What makes Jaipur tick like this? Is it just the quality of the food? If history and quality of food was the case, then Indore too would feature in this list - but it doesn't.Having visited both Jaipur and Indore recently, I can safely say that Indore probably has the best street food in India. Imagine a city with two markets dedicated to street food: Chappan Dukaan during day time and Sarafa Bazar at night. Sarafa comes alive at 9 pm when all the jewellers shut shop, and stalls are set up - and it keeps buzzing till the wee hours. While Jaipur with its kachori, mirchi-vada or mithai is rightly celebrated, Indore is strangely missing from this conversation about desi snacks. Unlike north India, Indore understands breakfast and does it well. One can stop at any of the small shops or shacks around this city for a five-minute breakfast of Indori poha, often served on a piece of newspaper with a steel spoon. Then tea, which is consistently good at any shop in Indore.One needs to visit Sarafa twice. It needs a visit during the day to be able to sample Nagori's legendary shikanji, which unlike north India is not a drink made of lemon juice, sugar and water but is something like liquid kulfi - with some sellers even using yoghurt to give it a different taste. The day visit is also needed to meet another legend in the same market at Joshi Dahi Bada, who is an artist and makes the best dahi vadas that you would find anywhere. With his showmanship, he turns a serving of a simple dahi vada into theatre. The greatest secret that Indore's streets have is something else though: it is called bhutte ka kees, and is made using grated corn, milk, lemon, coconut and the mildest of spices. What makes Indore's street food special is that the Indoris know how to use sugar in their food. So both poha and bhutte ka kees have a mild use of sugar that does not overpower the taste, but takes it to another level.As the erstwhile capital of the Holkars, Indore has enough history around it to be a good tourist destination. The Rococo-style palace at Lal Bagh is one of the most beautiful palaces in India, with opulence that can amaze you but requires urgent and massive restoration. One can also visit Mandu with its fort or the town of Maheshwar, the home of the Maheshwari silk sarees, on the banks of the serene Narmada river which used to be the capital of the Holkars before it was moved to Indore in 1818 AD.Jaipur and Indore are two cities that have a lot of similarity - with a rich history, booming trade and exceptional food. It makes you wish the Delhi-Agra-Jaipur triangle was actually a quadrilateral with Indore being the fourth corner."}

It goes like this:Like Simple Simon, Delhi's chief minister wants new pies without pennies. Last February the Aam Aadmi Party cocked a snook at the BJP and gave Mr Kejriwal a thundering majority on an anti-corruption platform; this New Year, Delhi's particulate matter has taken over - an enveloping fug so awful that many of its inhabitants are choking on dangerously high levels of pollution. The city hasn't had such a dreadful press in decades.The chief minister in cosy jersey and muffler, who once promised free water and power at slashed rates, is introducing odd-even use of cars from January 1. It may be a good idea, and even help ward off bad publicity. The trouble is that Simple Simon Mr Kejriwal has neither the organisation and planning, nor the power and the \"penny\" to execute it.Delhi has 8.5 million vehicles - with 1,400 cars added every day - and there are plenty of honest people trying to carpool, or swap cars with friends, including Chief Justice T S Thakur. But this is also the capital of privilege, of entrenched hierarchies and corrupt entitlements. The line-up of those seeking exemptions hasn't stopped growing; in addition to 25 categories exempted, including auto-rickshaws and women drivers, lawyers also wanted to be let off. The high court shot down the request, and also asked why three-wheelers and women drivers were so special?VIPs such as ministers, defence personnel and other superior classes will continue to flash their lal batti exemptions. If a recent wedding celebration at a Cabinet minister's home was anything of an indicator, serpentine VIP cavalcades are unlikely to be shorn of vehicles bristling with security and hangers-on. Car number-plate makers at nukkad stalls are said to be doing a roaring business in flogging fake plates.Yet Simple Simon Mr Kejriwal is unperturbed. Turning up at a local school this week he said the odd-even scheme would be \"good fun\" and urged children to exhibit Gandhigiri by persuading car owners to follow the two-week trial. \"Maza ayega,\" he added. In fact he was in favour of shutting down schools altogether for a fortnight till parents and courts protested.Many of his ideas since he came to power more than 10 months ago have been consigned to the waste bin, such as abolition of lal batti culture; others, like demanding an audit of alleged extortion by power distribution companies (discoms), have been thrown out by the high court and the CAG who have questioned his locus. His promises of \"x\" number of hospitals and \"y\" number of medical colleges to improve health care services were buried this summer when the capital reported a staggering 10,683 cases of dengue - the worst epidemic since 1996.Other than being one of the most polluted places on the planet, administering Delhi is intrinsically defective: there are simply too many centres of power. But Mr Kejriwal doesn't believe in the politics of negotiation, consensus or compromise.He is by nature obdurate and confrontationist. Having quarreled with party cohorts like Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan he's been on a constant collision course with Lt Governor Najeeb Jung and Police Commissioner B S Bassi. His daily haranguing of political opponents and officials have resulted in the subordinate bureaucracy going on strike in the opening week of implementing the odd-even car formula. His acerbity shouldn't be mistaken for simple-mindedness, however. When his principal secretary, Rajendra Kumar, was recently raided and 12 bottles of whisky found at his residence, he did not consider it a big deal.Mr Kejriwal's argument for lack of governance is that he is a chief minister without adequate powers. Surely he knew his remit from the moment he took office - that the city is a Union territory, with limits on his authority. Law and order is controlled by the Union home ministry; municipalities and land agencies are governed by the Ministry of Urban Development.Traffic congestion is a major source of pollution but it is one of several. Two chief causes are managing waste disposal and industrial pollution. He has taken no serious steps to curtail either; strict action on either front would mean taking on two important vote banks: hordes of incompetent municipal workers and small-time manufacturers responsible for industrial pollution.Simple Simon Mr Kejriwal's solution of a two-week trial with odd-even cars is a shrewd fail-safe proposition: if it works, even marginally, he will take all the credit. If it fizzles out, he can always blame his enemies - he has made so many that even he can't begin counting.       "}

As per its latest filings with the Registrar of Companies (RoC), LG Electronics India's sales grew 12% to Rs 12,958.6 crore in the last fiscal year ended March, 2015.   Profit after tax rose 20% to Rs 761 crore. Division-wise, LG India's sales expanded 16% in air-conditioning, 12% in home appliances and 11% in home entertainment. Smartphone business grew 12%.   \"LG has been pursuing premiumisation, which does not mean just high-priced products but also launching mass premium products such as single-door refrigerator with added feature or new colours and design at a slightly higher price which adds to higher margin leading to better profitability,\" a senior industry executive said.    In response to an email sent to the company, an LG India spokesman said the company has launched flagship models across product categories based on Indian consumer insight. \"Technology leadership is the key reason for this good growth and we will further strengthen our market leadership in consumer durable industry,\" he said.   The strong performance comes after three years of struggle for the company, as sales remained flat with it failing to overcome poor consumer sentiment. Struggling to position itself as a premium brand, LG exited the old-box CRT televisions, while its performance in smartphones remained poor. Ace rival   Samsung  had in the meantime galloped ahead in the   Indian market , riding high on its smartphone business.   However, this year, Samsung India's growth and profitability faltered with the company reporting one of its worst ever performance with revenue rising by a mere 4% to Rs 39,443.3 crore and net profit falling 47% to Rs 1,398.5 crore.   LG India is targeting more than 20% growth in the current fiscal year as well under a new managing director, Kim Ki-Wan, who has been cherrypicked by its Korean parent, a senior industry executive said. \"The company is more aggressive this year and has dropped prices in certain models to drive sales. It is also trying to empower branch and regional managers to create an autonomy to accelerate sales,\" he said.   LG is among the top three brands in   LED  televisions in India, while it is the market leader in refrigerators, washing machines and microwave ovens. In smartphones, LG has around a 2% share and is targeting 10% by end-2016. ", "section": "Business", "day": 1}

The dispute resolution panel (DRP), set up under the income tax act as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, had disallowed exemptions under various heads, including network site rentals, annual license fee, unaccounted income, depreciation on 3G spectrum and transfer pricing adjustments on advertisements and marketing expenses.   It had also referred the matter back to the assessing officer (AO).   A bench of justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and Sanjeev Sachdeva last week allowed the AO to pass the assessment order but asked him not to give effect to it till the next date of hearing on February 18.   The court also issued notice to the Centre,   DRP  and the Income Tax (IT) department and sought their replies on Vodafone's plea alleging that the panel's November 16 order disallowing the exemptions was \"illegal and arbitrary\" and contrary to provisions of the IT Act.   The AO had in March 2015 passed a draft assesssment order, disallowing the exemptions sought by Vodafone.   The draft order was challenged by the company before the DRP which on November 16, had disallowed the objections raised by it and remanded back the matter back to the AO, the petition filed by Vodafone said.   The telecom major has contended that the panel, while disallowing the objections, had said that the proposed addition of over Rs 2800 crore has to be made to its taxable income for the AY 2011-12.   It also claimed that the panel gave no reasons for dismissing the objections.   \"Huge additions have been proposed solely on a complete and prima facie non-application of mind..,\" Vodafone has alleged in its plea against the DRP order.

Everywhere our sensors show that Daesh is going on the defensive... as shown in the loss of Ramadi,\" he said, using an Arabic acronym for IS. Earlier this week, Iraqi forces pushed ISIS fighters out of the city west of Baghdad with air support from the coalition in an important setback for the group. \"Several weeks ago, France was hit at its heart,\" Le Drian told 250 French troops gathered in the carrier's aircraft hangar among Rafale and Super Etendard jets. The Charles de Gaulle set off for the eastern Mediterranean shortly after ISIS claimed November 13 bombing and shootings in Paris that killed 130 people and wounded many more. \"The aggression on our soil calls for a retaliation where Daesh is organising to hit us,\" he said, referring to ISIS training camps in Syria. The aircraft carrier has been stationed in the Gulf since December 20. \"Our aim is this terrorist organisation's destruction, pure and simple,\" he said. \"To destroy an enemy, you have to degrade its capacities, contain it,\" he said, referring to the airstrikes against the group's positions since summer 2014. \"You then must reduce it. For that, you need to act on the ground and that's what our local partners are doing with our support.\" Earlier this week, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria rolled the jihadists back across the Euphrates River. Marines from accompanying German and Belgian frigates were also aboard the aircraft carrier.

After a \"terrible\" year in which jihadists also attacked the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket and a heavily armed man attacked passengers on a high-speed train in France, Hollande said his \"first duty\" was to protect the French people. \"That means attacking the root of the evil, in Syria and Iraq.

Confronted by hate, it showed the strength of its values, the values of the Republic.\" The president was defiant on his plans to strip dual nationals who are convicted of terrorist offences of their French nationality.

Merkel has earned praise at home and abroad for her decision to allow in a record wave of refugees, about half from war-torn Syria. But with one million asylum seekers arriving in 2015 alone, opposition and doubts are growing, including within her own conservative camp and among the population. Acknowledging the immense task of dealing with the massive influx, Merkel braced Germans for more challenges ahead and made a strong call for unity. \"Next year is about one thing in particular: our cohesion,\" she said. \"It is important we don't allow ourselves to be divided. \"It is crucial not to follow those who, with coldness or even hatred in their hearts, lay a sole claim to what it means to be German and seek to exclude others,\" she urged, in a reference to ring-wing populists and xenophobic street rallies. The efforts put in to cope with the challenges would be worth it in the end because \"countries have always benefitted from successful immigration, both economically and socially\", she said. \"I am convinced that, handled properly, today's great task presented by the influx and the integration of so many people is an opportunity for tomorrow,\" said Merkel. Germany took in almost 1.1 million asylum seekers this year, five times last year's total, the Saechsische Zeitung regional daily reported Wednesday, citing unpublished official figures. 'Wishful thinking?' Merkel's unwavering stance on refugees has won her accolades, including from media organisations like Agence France-Presse, the Financial Times and Time which named her the most influential person of the year. But at home, her usually stellar ratings have fallen as opposition grows within her conservative camp and popular concerns rise about the influx. In a bid to counter these concerns, Merkel has vowed steps to reduce refugee numbers next year. Her plan involves persuading other EU members to take in more refugees, and an EU deal with gateway country Turkey to better protect its borders. Mindful of security concerns, Berlin is also tightening its scrutiny of asylum seekers by reintroducing individual interviews from Friday for all applicants, including Syrians, who had previously benefitted from simplified procedures. But several former eastern bloc countries have so far shown no signs of relenting, with Czech President Milos Zeman last week calling the current refugee influx to Europe \"an organised invasion\". Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government has meanwhile filed a legal challenge against the EU's plan to distribute 160,000 asylum-seekers under a quota system. \"Merkel's solution for the asylum seeker crisis remains wishful thinking,\" Die Welt newspaper said, adding that addressing the root causes of war and instability that are sending people fleeing to Europe is another tough task. \"2015 was certainly Angela Merkel's year. But 2016 should be a decisive year for her,\" it said. A European diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity predicted that \"if the number of refugees falls sharply, it would be fine, but if it continues at the current rate, it will be very difficult for her politically.\" Three regional elections to be held in March would serve as key tests, and opinion polls are already predicting a surge in support for the populist anti-refugee movement AfD. Merkel herself acknowledged that \"there has rarely been a year in which we were challenged so much to follow up our words with deeds\". \"There is no question that the influx of so many people will keep demanding much of us. \"It will take time, effort and money,\" she said, thanking volunteers and police, soldiers and administrators for their \"outstanding\" accomplishments and \"doing far, far more than their duty\".

At least 28 people have died in the U.S. Midwest's extreme weather since the weekend, mostly from driving into flooded areas after storms dropped up to 12 inches (30 cm) of rain, officials said. The days of downpours have pushed the mighty Mississippi and its tributaries to record highs or levels not seen in decades, the National Weather Service and local officials said. Southern states like Louisiana will be the next to lose homes and businesses to flooding as overflowing rivers push downstream towards the Gulf of Mexico, the National Weather Service said. The floodwaters have closed sections of Interstate 44 and Interstate 55, both major trucking routes, along with many smaller roads near rivers, Illinois and Missouri officials said on Thursday. Freezing temperatures in the area in the coming days will cause some flooded areas to turn icy, adding to challenges, forecasters said. Significant river flooding is expected for the lower Mississippi River, the second-longest river in the United States, into mid-January, the NWS said. As of Thursday morning, some 9.3 million people nationwide were in areas with flood warnings. That was down from 12.1 million on Wednesday and 17.7 million on Tuesday. Workers in Tennessee were preparing on Thursday for the Mississippi River in Memphis to reach flood stage over the weekend. \"We're moving things up high and we've got our generators out and got some extra water,\" said Dotty Kirkendoll, a clerk at Riverside Park Marina on McKellar Lake, which feeds off the Mississippi River. The U.S. Coast Guard issued a high water safety advisory on Thursday for more than 560 miles of the Lower Mississippi River from Caruthersville, Missouri, to near Natchez, Mississippi. It is expected to stay in effect for several weeks, based on NWS forecasts, the Coast Guard said. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has declared a state of emergency to prepare for flooding, and levee systems are being monitored daily. \"All that water's coming south and we have to be ready for it,\" Lieutenant Governor-Elect Billy Nungesser told CNN. \"It's a serious concern. It's early in the season. We usually don't see this until much later.\" River Damage Water rose to the rooftops of some structures in Missouri towns and two rivers west of St. Louis crested at historic levels, flooding towns, disabling sewer plants and forcing hundreds of residents from their homes. Eureka, Missouri, Mayor Kevin Coffey said his town had not seen such bad flooding in 150 years and some of its oldest businesses have been damaged. The Mississippi is expected to crest in the small town of Thebes, Illinois, at 47.5 feet on Sunday, more than a foot and a half (46 cm) above the 1995 record, the National Weather Service said. Thebes village worker Bobby White said some sewage pumps were shut down to avoid overloading and portable toilets had been supplied to affected areas. Most homes in the town, including his own, are on a hill and should be fine, he said. \"Most of the people at the bottom of the hill moved out years ago,\" White said. \"If [flooding] comes on the hill, all of Alexander County will be wiped out.\" Illinois officials have provided 800,000 sandbags to communities endangered by the Illinois, Sangamon, Iroquois and Mississippi rivers, said Patti Thompson, spokeswoman for the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. Some evacuees stayed with family or friends or went to hotels, while others found refuge in Red Cross shelters set up in the area. Rick Miller, U.S. property practice leader for Aon Risk Solutions, said it was too early to comment on possible damage costs. He said the majority of the impact will be to the National Flood Insurance Program. Miller does not expect the flooding, as bad as it has been, to be a \"significant insurance industry event\" and said the insurance impact of Hurricane Sandy in 2012 was far greater. \u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2016", "section": "Weather", "topics": {"WEATHER, CALAMITIES": 0.8648648648648649, "ECONOMIC GROWTH": 0.10810810810810811}, "day": 1}

Fireworks were cancelled in Brussels and Paris as November's terror attacks cast a pall. Yet at the stroke of midnight the skies still lit up with pyrotechnics in Sydney, traditionally the first to host a major New Year's bash, as crowds thronged to waterside vantage points. Tens of thousands of revellers gathered on either side of Hong Kong's iconic Victoria Harbour, which was bathed in a dazzling fireworks display. In Dubai, at least 16 people were injured when a huge fire ripped through a luxury 63-storey hotel, the Address Downtown, near the world's tallest tower where crowds were gathering to watch New Year's Eve celebrations. The cause of the blaze was not immediately known but the building was safely evacuated and the emirate's government announced that the end-of-year celebrations, including a massive fireworks show at the Burj Khalifa tower, would go ahead as scheduled. The chimes of midnight will move across Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Europe and finally the Americas. In the heart of Europe, more than 100,000 police were to be deployed throughout France to guard celebrations that come six weeks after the jihadist attacks in Paris. France \"has not finished with terrorism yet\", President Francois Hollande said in his New Year address, adding the threat of another attack \"remains at its highest level\". Annual festivities and fireworks in Brussels were cancelled as the Belgian capital -- home to NATO and the European Union -- remains on high alert. \"It's better not to take any risks,\" Brussels mayor Yvan Mayeur said. Belgian officials are battling terror on two fronts -- with police on Thursday holding five people over an alleged New Year attack plot in Brussels as well as arresting a tenth suspect over the Paris attacks. Paris, still reeling from the November 13 slaughter of 130 people, has also cancelled its main fireworks display on the Champs Elysees avenue. But authorities agreed France's biggest public gathering since the attacks can go ahead on the famous boulevard, with bolstered security. \"The people of Paris and France need this symbolic passage into the New Year,\" Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo told the weekly Journal du Dimanche. High security Hong Kong, Beijing, Singapore and other Asian cities may rival Sydney's pyrotechnic splash, but Brunei will offer a sober evening after banning Christmas in a shift to hardline Islamic law. Jakarta remains on high alert after anti-terror police foiled detailed plans for an alleged New Year suicide attack in the Indonesian capital. Turkish police have detained two Islamic State suspects allegedly planning to stage attacks in the centre of the capital Ankara which is expected to be packed on New Year's Eve. Meanwhile, in Moscow police will for the first time close off Red Square where tens of thousands of revellers traditionally gather. \"It's no secret that Moscow is one of the choice targets for terrorists,\" Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said recently. In Britain, Scotland Yard said there will be around 3,000 officers across central London in what is reported to be an unprecedented anti-terror security effort. \"Our plans are purely precautionary and not as a result of any specific intelligence,\" said Superintendent Jo Edwards, spokeswoman for Scotland Yard. Fireworks were banned in towns and cities across Italy, in some cases because of a recent spike in air pollution but also because of fears that, in the current climate, sudden loud bangs could cause crowds to panic. In Madrid, thousands of people will flock to Puerta del Sol square, however police will limit the number allowed in to just 25,000. Berliners will do better with about a million expected at the Brandenburg Gate for a free mega-street party. Party at the pyramids Cairo meanwhile is trying desperately to attract tourists to bolster the economy. The government is staging celebrations in front of the pyramids near the Egyptian capital, with ambassadors, artists and intellectuals all invited. Egypt has been in turmoil since the 2011 uprising but was further hit by the October 31 crash of a Russian airliner over the Sinai killing 224 people. In stark contrast, Sierra Leone's capital Freetown is hoping to reclaim its mantle as host of the best beach parties in Africa after Ebola scared people away. The city of 1.2 million was deserted 12 months ago during the worst Ebola outbreak ever recorded. \"This New Year's Eve I am going to dance and party until the cock crows,\" said 35-year-old Franklyn Smith. In the United States, authorities said they had arrested and charged a 25-year-old American Muslim convert over an alleged attempt to launch a New Year's Eve attack in upstate New York in the name of the Islamic State group. In New York City, despite a pledge of tight security for Times Square, another million people are expected to turn out to see the ball descend.

A judge agreed on Thursday to hear the case of Ethan Cohen, 18, who was detained on Monday with his mother in a Pacific resort city, a National Migration Institute official told AFP. While her son faces an indefinite stay at the facility in an impoverished Mexico City neighborhood, Tonya Couch was flown to Los Angeles on Wednesday and promptly taken into custody by the US Marshals Service. Lawyers for Ethan Cohen had filed an appeal for him -- but not his mother -- in Mexico on Wednesday. The judge had 72 hours to decide whether to take up the case. \"The injunction was ratified. He will be here for the time that is necessary\" for the deportation case to close, the migration official said on condition of anonymity, adding that the process could take weeks or months. In 2013, the teen crashed his pickup into a group of pedestrians in Texas and another vehicle, leaving four dead and several seriously injured. Couch, who was 16 at the time, had a blood-alcohol level nearly three times the legal limit for an adult. The son of millionaire parents made headlines during his trial when a psychologist testifying on his behalf claimed he suffered from \"affluenza.\" The term, coined from affluence and influenza, implied that financial privilege made him unable to understand the consequences of his actions. Couch pleaded guilty to intoxication manslaughter. Prosecutors had sought a 20-year prison term, but the court handed him a surprise sentence of mental health treatment and a decade of probation. The leniency caused outrage among many Americans. 'No special treatment' Couch disappeared earlier this month after he missed a mandatory meeting with his probation officer. He apparently vanished after the emergence of a video showing Couch at a party taking part in a drinking game, which violated the terms of his probation. This led to a manhunt that ended when Mexican authorities caught Ethan and Tonya Couch on Monday night on a street in Puerto Vallarta, a popular beach resort in western Jalisco state. Mexican and US officials say the two illegally entered the country in a pickup truck and were unable to show proper documentation when they were detained. Ethan Couch had dyed his blond hair black. His mother faces US charges of hindering his apprehension. The son, who had been held with her at a migration facility in Jalisco's capital, Guadalajara, was transferred to Mexico City in a van that arrived early Thursday. The wealthy young American will share an open room with three other migrants at a facility known as Las Agujas, the migration official said. Couch will get three meals per day, including a special one for New Year's Eve. The facility has a basketball court and a common room with television. Cellphones are prohibited, but he can use the facility's phones. Couch is staying in the men's section of the 500-capacity center. \"It's like a shelter where all the foreigners who will be deported are taken,\" the official said. \"There's no special treatment.\"                ", "section": "Entertainment", "topics": {"INTERNATIONAL ISSUES": 0.1111111111111111, "INTERNATIONAL ENTERTAINMENT, INTERNATIONAL CELEBRITIES": 0.5833333333333334, "GOVERNMENT, GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS": 0.05555555555555555, "LAW, COURTS, TRIBUNAL": 0.1388888888888889}, "day": 1}

Emanuel L. Lutchman, who claimed to have received direction from an alleged member of Islamic State, also known as IS, wanted to target a restaurant in Rochester, New York, where he lives, according to a criminal complaint. Lutchman was arrested on Wednesday. The complaint said Lutchman told a paid informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation that they could plant a bomb inside the establishment and also kidnap and kill people. \"I will take a life. I don't have a problem with that,\" Lutchman said, according to the complaint, which said he planned to use knives during the attack. The complaint described Lutchman as a \"self-professed Muslim convert with a criminal history dating back to approximately 2006 ... as well as previous state mental hygiene arrests.\" Lutchman appeared in U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York on Thursday. The charge he faces carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The City of Rochester said on Twitter it had cancelled a fireworks display set for Thursday night. Police Chief Michael Ciminelli said there was no credible threat but cancelling the fireworks would allow more police officers to be available elsewhere in the city as a precaution, according to ABC affiliate WHAM-TV. The complaint said that in November and December Lutchman expressed support for Islamic State in telephone conversations with another paid informant for the FBI. It said he had been in contact this month with a person claiming to be a member of the Islamic State militant group in Syria.

Both Brussels and Paris cancelled annual New Year's Eve fireworks displays as soldiers and police ramped up security in European capitals over perceived terror threats. There were instead plenty of private firework displays throughout the Belgian capital at midnight, accompanied by cheers and loud music, but the celebrations were vastly diminished compared to last year's. \"People are scared. They are staying home and avoiding public places,\" taxi driver Abdullah told AFP in the Ixelles neighbourhood as he waited for customers who he estimated have dropped 40 percent this year. Police detained six people Thursday for questioning over an alleged plot to strike \"emblematic sites\" in Brussels during the year-end festivities. But three of them were released after interviews and the others were ordered provisionally held for another 24 hours as the investigation continues, the federal prosecutor's office said. The prosecutor's office also said two men, whom they identified as Said S., 30, and Mohammed K., 27, had already been formally charged with terrorism-related offences and remained in custody. The men's lawyers said their full names are Said Saouti and Mohammed Karay, whose arrests were announced Tuesday following police raids in and around Brussels and the eastern city of Liege. The men denied the charges against them, the lawyers added. Police seized military-style training uniforms, computer hardware and Islamic State propaganda material in the earlier raids. In Thursday's raids, they found computer equipment, mobile phones and airgun equipment, the prosecutor's office said. A source close to the investigation told AFP that officials were trying to determine whether members of a motorcycle gang called the \"Kamikaze Riders\" were involved in the year-end plot. 'Terrorist murder' Brussels has been on high alert since it emerged that several of the attackers involved in the Paris carnage on November 13 had links to the Belgian capital. Prosecutors said Thursday they had arrested a 10th suspect over the attacks in Paris claimed by the Islamic State group that killed 130 people and wounded many more. They charged him with terror offences. The Belgian national, identified only as Ayoub B., was detained on Wednesday during a raid on a house in the troubled Brussels immigrant neighbourhood of Molenbeek, the federal prosecutor's office said. He has been charged with \"terrorist murder\" and involvement in the activities of a terrorist group, it said, adding that he would appear in court again within five days for a custody hearing. Molenbeek is home to the Paris attacks fugitive Salah Abdeslam and has served in the past decades as a haven for jihadists. Brussels Mayor Yvan Mayeur said Wednesday that fireworks and related events in the central square of Place de Brouckere had been cancelled because it was not possible to \"guarantee that we can check everyone coming to the event\". Last year, some 100,000 people turned out to watch the traditional New Year's Eve fireworks display. 'Terrorists are winning' Alex, another taxi driver, told AFP that \"the terrorists are winning\" as business had dropped by about half this year while some cafe owners said they were closing several hours early for lack of customers. It is not the first time the official New Year's Eve fireworks have been cancelled as the authorities made the same decision in 2007 because of another terror threat. Officials said the plot revealed Tuesday was not directly linked to the wave of bombings and shootings on a Paris concert venue, bars, restaurants and the national stadium.

Cameron said aspects of being in the European Union were the cause of \"so much frustration\" in Britain -- but ultimately voters would decide whether the country remains in the bloc. He is attempting to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership, ahead of an in-or-out referendum due by the end of 2017. No date has been set for the vote, though newspapers and political commentators have speculated that it could well come in 2016. \"It's a New Year, and Britain begins it with renewed strength. With a lower deficit and enterprise flourishing, our economy is becoming more secure by the day,\" Cameron said in his New Year message. \"For me, there are no New Year's resolutions, just the resolve to continue delivering what we promised in our manifesto.\" His Conservative Party was returned to power with a majority in May. \"We're fighting hard to fix the aspects of our EU membership that cause so much frustration in Britain -- so we get a better deal for our country,\" he said. \"It is a difficult negotiation with 27 other countries. But throughout we are driven by one consideration: what is best for Britain's economic and national security. \"In the end, you will decide whether we are stronger and better off with our European neighbours as part of the European Union, or on our own.\" Cameron said he thought Britain was in the middle of a \"great reforming decade\", a \"turnaround\" period where a revived economy could spur \"real social renewal\". Cameron listed four things he wanted to \"get done\" in 2016. He said he wanted to tackle extremism by combating \"hate preachers\" but also segregated parallel communities and a \"failure to integrate\". Cameron pledged to build 200,000 starter homes to tackle the moral \"outrage\" of young people priced out of the property market. He said he wanted to combat \"stubborn and persistent poverty\", and lift the barriers of social mobility, calling it a \"scandal\" that there were more young black men in prison than studying at top universities. \"If we really get to grips with these problems this year, we won't just be a richer nation, but a stronger, more unified, more secure one,\" Cameron said. \"We remain on the long walk to a Greater Britain.

The Wall Street Journal, quoting unnamed US officials, said that financial sanctions being developed by the US Treasury Department remain on the table, after the decision to delay them. At one point they were scheduled to be announced Wednesday in Washington, the newspaper said, citing a notification the White House sent to Congress. The officials gave no definitive timeline for when the sanctions would be imposed, it said. The WSJ reported on Wednesday that the US was preparing fresh sanctions against companies and individuals in Iran, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates over alleged links to Tehran's ballistic missile program. Such a step by the Treasury Department could present a major barrier to the nuclear deal's implementation, let alone its durability, and come with relations between Tehran and Washington deteriorating once more. They would be the first American sanctions against Iran since Tehran signed the nuclear deal with world powers in July that will eventually see Washington drop separate sanctions targeting that program. A senior administration official said in a statement to AFP that \"we've been looking for some time at options for additional actions related to Iran's ballistic missile program. \"We are considering various aspects related to additional designations, as well as evolving diplomatic work that is consistent with our national security interests.\" Earlier Thursday, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani denounced the possible new US penalties, calling them \"hostile and illegal interventions\" that justified a response.

While China's services sector ended 2015 on a strong note, the economy still looked set to grow at its slowest pace in a quarter of a century, suggesting the government will have to step up support in 2016 to revive activity. The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)stood at 49.7 in December, in line with expectations of economists polled by Reuters and up only fractionally from November. A reading below 50 points suggests a contraction in activity, while a reading above indicates an expansion on a monthly basis. Persistently soft demand from at home and abroad has weighed on China's factories, leaving many with idle capacity and forcing them to slash selling prices, eating into their profits and adding to deflationary pressures in the broader economy. Total new orders - a proxy for both domestic and foreign demand - rose to 50.2 in December from November's 49.8, the PMI survey showed. But export orders shrank for the 15th straight month, albeit at a less severe pace. The sub-index inched up to 47.5 from November's 46.4. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said although oil prices were very low at present, cash at the end of the year was tight for factories, putting relatively large pressure on manufacturers. China's economic growth is expected to cool from 7.3 percent in 2014 to 6.9 percent in 2015, the central bank said in a recent work paper, its slowest pace 25 years. It said growth could ease further to 6.8 percent in 2016. Some China watchers, however, believe real growth levels are already much weaker than official data suggest. Top leaders last week outlined the main economic targets for 2016, saying the government will push forward \"supply-side reform\" to help generate new growth engines as rust-belt industries such as steelmaking suffer. Some analysts expect Beijing will roll out more easing measures in the first quarter of 2016, including further cuts in interest rates and banks' reserve requirement ratios to help re-energise activity. But the economy already has taken longer than usual to respond to a year-long blitz of easing measures and stimulus, suggesting it is facing more deep-rooted cyclical and structural weaknesses than in past downturns. A similar official survey on the services sector showed activity quickened in December. The services sector has been the lone bright spot in the economy in the last few years, helping to offset prolonged weakness in the vast manufacturing sector, though financial markets tend to focus more closely on factory readings. The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI) rose to 54.4, from November's 53.6, according to the NBS. The services sector has accounted for the bigger part of China's economic output for at least two years, with its share rising to 48.2 percent in 2014, compared with the 42.6 percent contribution from manufacturing and construction. A private gauge of Chinese manufacturing Caixin/Markit PMI, which focuses more on small-to-medium-sized private firms, will be released on Jan.4. China is set to release fourth quarter and full-year GDP data on January 19. \u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2016", "section": "Finance", "topics": {"BUSINESS PROFIT AND LOSS": 0.125, "STOCK MARKET": 0.5, "ECONOMIC GROWTH": 0.25}, "day": 1}

Not long before, he had entered the balcony with a friend to take photographs of the nearby New Year's Eve fireworks display for his newspaper.

Afraid that he would die from suffocation, and unable to see how he could escape, the photographer decided there was only one thing for it: to tie a rope from himself to a window-cleaning platform and hang off the balcony. He rolled out some 30 metres (100 feet) of a heavy-duty cable from a nearby machine used by workers to clean the tower's windows, attached it to his belt and photographing equipment and stepped off the edge.

Civil defence representatives kept him calm as he waited to be rescued. \"I was telling them I hoped to survive and see my wife,\" he said. More than half an hour later, he heard rescue workers approaching his floor. \"When I saw lights and heard the sounds of footsteps at the floor I was in, I started tapping on the aluminium to get their attention,\" he said. \"I think I was the only person left stuck that long,\" he said, describing how he was led out through the smoke-filled corridors of the five-star hotel. Dubai's police chief said that all the residents had been evacuated due to the blaze, the cause of which was unknown. \u00a0 Not far away, Dubai's fireworks display erupted as usual to welcome in the new year, starting from the Burj Khalifa -- the world's tallest building -- before spreading across the skies above the city. For the photographer, the start of 2016 is something he will never forget. \"I'm excited because it's New Year, and (filled with) an adrenaline rush,\" he told AFP, his voice still shaky.

German authorities were tipped off by a \"friendly intelligence service\" about the plan, which ISIS had planned to carry out around midnight, said Joachim Herrmann, interior minister for the southern state of Bavaria. \"Five to seven\" suspects were believed to be planning to carry out a \"suicide attack\" as festivities were under way to welcome in the New Year, Munich police chief Hubertus Andrae said. Police evacuated Munich's main rail station and another station in the western suburb of Pasing after an alert of a possible \"terror attack\". Rail services at the sites were also halted and police urged the public to keep away from large gatherings. Some 550 officers had been deployed to track down the suspects and secure the sites, although no arrests have been made yet. Police officers, some in riot gear, were posted at different entrances of Munich's main rail station which was eerily quiet on a night of traditionally raucous celebrations. Some revellers sought to enter the station but were turned away. A police spokeswoman said it could not be ruled out that the attackers could seek another target. German media had earlier reported that police were acting on a tip from French authorities. European capitals are on high security alert, with Brussels and Paris both scrapping fireworks for New Year's celebrations. Belgian police were also holding five people over an alleged New Year plot in Brussels. In Berlin, police presence has been stepped up at the Brandenburg Gate, where hundreds of thousands of people have gathered for festivities. All large bags and backpacks have been banned from the site of the huge street party. Days after the November 13 attacks in Paris claimed by the ISIS group that left 130 dead, German police called off an international football match at the last minute due to a bomb threat. No explosives were subsequently found, and no arrests made after the Germany-Netherlands friendly in Hanover -- which was to be attended by Chancellor Angela Merkel -- was cancelled and thousands of fans evacuated. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere -- who had been due to attend the match with Merkel -- later said the event was cancelled \"to protect the population\", but did not provide specifics.

Far from being flooded with pilgrims, as the Italian authorities had anticipated, the streets around St Peter's basilica have been eerily quiet over the end-of-year holiday season, following attacks in France in November. \"There seems to be the same number of people about as this time last year,\" said one of the street traders in the Via della Conciliazione, who did not want to give his name. \"But it is clear the crowds we were told to expect have not materialised.\" The view from the street is confirmed by official figures from the Vatican, which revealed earlier this week that the number of people attending papal audiences were 30 per cent down from the same time last year. Italian media have jumped on the figures to predict that the Jubilee year, which runs until November 20, is set to be a flop, largely as a result of the impact of the jihadist attacks on Paris. \u00a0 During the last Catholic Jubilee year, in 2000, nearly 150 pilgrims went through the doors of St Peter's every minute and a total of 32 million visited Rome during the year. According to the Eternal City's hotel and restaurant federation, hotel occupancy rates are running at 70 per cent currently, down from 90 per cent at this time last year. But it seems likely that is not only the fear of terrorist attacks that is keeping people away. While Catholics have been encouraged to visit Rome during previous Jubilees, Francis has this time around asked cathedrals around the world to open holy doors which believers can pass through without leaving their own countries. Bearing a cross Traditionally, passing through a holy door during a Jubilee enables a believer to benefit from special indulgences -- although modern theologians tend to phrase the act as an opportunity for the faithful to renew their relationship with Christ. Once in Rome, pilgrims who want to pass through the Holy Door at St Peter's have to register, like runners in a marathon, in a tent staffed by volunteers near the Castel Sant'Angelo, an erstwhile papal fortress located just outside the Vatican. Groups can opt, for a small fee, to borrow a wooden cross which one of them will carry on his shoulders for the final stretch of their journey to St Peter's. Places for papal audiences and other major events during the Jubilee are distributed at a welcome centre on the Via della Conciliazione, where pilgrims can also, for two euros, purchase a \"parchment\" -- a certificate printed on regular paper -- as a souvenir and record of their visit. \"We don't have a figure for the number of pilgrims per day but there has been a steady flow,\" said Massimiliano, the Vatican official in charge of the centre. Asked about the relative lack of publicity for the Jubilee year in the streets of Rome compared with 2000, Massimiliano said the low-key nature of the event was in keeping with Francis's discreet style. And in the Ancora religious bookshop, Father Giuliano shrugged off his lack of customers. \"A Holy Year is judged over a whole year,\" he said. \"Those who think it offers a wonderful opportunity to come to Rome still have plenty of time. I'm not at all worried.\" The young souvenir seller shared his optimism. \"The pilgrims will come at Easter, as usual.\"                ", "section": "Events", "topics": {"STOCK MARKET": 0.20689655172413793, "PUBLIC EVENTS, CELEBRATIONS, AWARDS, FESTIVAL": 0.27586206896551724, "CRIME": 0.034482758620689655}, "day": 1}

Many of the families had made a brave dash for safety across the front lines to escape attempts by retreating Islamic State fighters to take them as human shields. But the men who got away have now been detained by Iraqi security forces for investigation, in a reminder of the deep suspicion with which those who have been living under Islamic State rule are regarded by the Iraqi government. The Iraqi army launched a new offensive on Thursday to recapture the remaining Ramadi neighborhoods still held by the Islamic State. Iraqi military officials estimate that around a quarter of the city is still in militant hands, and U.S. officials say as many as 400 to 700 Islamic State fighters are still holed up in the Ramadi area, including in the city center. \"It's tough to determine the current enemy head count remaining in downtown Ramadi at this point, given the dynamic nature of the last few weeks,\" said Col. Steve Warren, the U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad, in an email. The Islamic State does not have the ability to recapture the city, but fully securing it could \"take some time,\" he said. \"Every house is potentially booby-trapped and must be checked.\" There is also unexploded ordnance strewn around the streets, and water and electricity facilities are badly damaged, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), meaning it could be even longer before it is safe for residents to return. Displaced Iraqi people, who fled the violence in the Iraqi city of Ramadi, celebrate after their city was liberated from the ISIS on December 29, 2015 at the Alkzenzanah camp in the capital Baghdad. (AFP Photo) Sabah Karhot, the head of Anbar's provincial council, said as much as 80 percent of Ramadi has been destroyed in the battles. Ramadi has been continuously fought over for the past two years, since the Islamic State swept into parts of the city in January 2014. They captured all of it last May. The Iraqi army retook most of the city on Monday, including the compound housing the provincial government, in a big boost for Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi and for the demoralized government security forces. Most of the 400 or so people who managed to escape the fighting are being sheltered at a camp for displaced people in the Anbar town of Habbaniyah, which is under the control of Iraq's Shiite-dominated government. Islamic State fighters are Sunnis. Aysha Mohammed, 31, described how Islamic State fighters came to her neighborhood as the Iraqi army closed in and ordered families to accompany them as they retreated to another part of the city. \"They knocked at the door and told my husband to prepare for us to leave with them, because the Rawafidh and infidels are coming to kill us all,\" she said, using a derogatory term for Shiites. So close were the advancing Iraqi army soldiers, however, that Mohammed and her family could hear the voices of the soldiers, shouting through loudspeakers and urging residents to escape. They decided to make a run for it. \"We waited until ISIS went to another alley, and we all left together. Me, my husband and my children were running together with other families, around 15 in all,\" she recalled, using an acronym for Islamic State. \"We ran for about 10 minutes. We were afraid that ISIS would shoot us, but they didn't see us.\" After they reached army positions, the men were separated from the women and children and taken away - 76 from among the 400 or so people housed at Habbaniyah, according to Iraqi officials. \"I just want my father to come back to us. He is not Daesh,\" said Zaid, Mohammed's 7- year-old son, using another acronym for Islamic State. He said his family had hated living under the militants. \"I saw them whipping people in the market. It made me afraid,\" said Zaid, who stopped studying after the Islamic State took over last May because they closed all the schools. \"They cut off someone's head in front of people. I didn't see it, but I heard about it.\" Souad Salih, 19, said she and her husband had been yearning to leave for months, but the Islamic State refused to allow anyone to depart from the town. \"They treated us like prisoners, she said. \"When we heard the Iraqi army was coming, we were very happy, but at the same time afraid because of the war. We were praying that ISIS would just run away and leave us alone, but they tried to take us with them.\" \"I am very happy right now. Even though I am living in a camp, at least I am not among the savages,\" she added. \"I just hope my husband will join me soon.\" Falih al-Issawi, the deputy head of the Anbar provincial council, said he was personally supervising the interrogation of the detained men. He promised that \"all of those who are innocent\" will be released. Not all are, however, he added, describing how an 8-year-old boy had informed on his father, telling authorities the man had been working with the Islamic State. And not all of the families in Ramadi managed to escape. The Islamic State is still holding more than 200 families as human shields, Karhot said. One group of people tried to escape on Wednesday, but Islamic State fighters saw them and opened fire, killing many of them, he said. According to Hamid al-Dulaimi, the mayor of Ramadi, the families still being held hostage are \"the main obstacle\" to recapturing the rest of the city. \"They are being used by Daesh as human shields,\" he said. \u00a9 2015 The Washington Post                ", "section": "International", "topics": {"TRANSPORTATION, ROAD SAFETY": 0.06896551724137931, "INTERNATIONAL NEWS": 0.41379310344827586, "POLICE": 0.06896551724137931, "NATIONAL SECURITY, TERRORISM, SECURITY AGENCY": 0.034482758620689655}, "day": 1}

For more than a decade, the 39-year-old professional sports bettor (real name: Dave Oancea) has routinely spent $20,000 to $30,000 - by his own estimate - on pricey Champagne, the best tables and limo service for the dozen or so friends he parties with in Las Vegas at year's end. The most desirable tables at his favorite clubs might go for $5,000 any other night of the year, but he knows what happens on New Year's Eve: Prices triple. \"You can sit in a terrible area for, like, $5,000 on New Year's - like by the bathroom,\" he said. This year, Oancea stayed in - he has a girlfriend now - but across the country, countless people paid a premium to not be home when the ball drops. Call it surge pricing on bar stools, breadsticks and everything in between. As businesses across the country pick the confetti from their floors, recycle their wine bottles and perhaps tidy up the back of their cabs, everyone from nightclub owners to Uber drivers will be tallying up their earnings from one of night life's most lucrative days of the year. \u00a0 \"New Year's Eve is pretty much going to determine for some venues whether you're going to be in the red or in the black,\" said J.C. Diaz, executive director of the Nightlife Association, a trade group of bars, restaurants, nightclubs and rave festivals, and also the founder of the Nightlife Hall of Fame. \"I would say it's financially imperative that they close out the year with a bang.\" Of all the businesses that look to cash in on New Year's Eve, clubs and bars are among the most aggressive, of course. Nightclubs, which already double, triple or even quadruple the price of a bottle of alcohol, often send their prices even higher on Dec. 31. On a typical night at the nightclub TAO in Las Vegas, for example, partygoers must agree to spend a minimum of $550 to $5,000 to get a table. On New Year's Eve, that minimum ranges from $1,500 to $15,000, according to a spokeswoman, Maggie Rubenstein. Tickets to TAO and its sister venue, Marquee Nightclub and Dayclub, were set starting at $100 on New Year's Eve, compared with a typical cover charge that starts at $15 for TAO and $25 at Marquee, Rubenstein said. \"New Year's Eve is the biggest night of the year for nightclubs and promoters,\" said Barak Schurr, the founder and president of Wantickets, an online ticket vendor focused on night life and clubs. Nightclubs and promoters, he said, \"try and cast the widest and biggest net they can.\" For instance, poolside cabanas at the Fontainebleau in Miami for the Weeknd and Kygo concert sold out for Thursday night on Schurr's website - for about $28,000 each. On a normal night, Wantickets might sell those spots for about a quarter of that price, he said. The $28,000 also got a party of 15 six bottles of Champagne and liquor and \"Red Bull party favors,\" according to Wantickets.com. Nightclubs are not the only businesses with dollar signs in their eyes. Airbnb said it expected to break records for bookings in a single day. At the Olive Garden in Times Square, where entrees typically run $20 to $30, revelers could buy a $400 dinner with a full buffet, multiple open bars and a DJ (A year ago, the chain charged $350.) A spokeswoman for Olive Garden, Jessica Dinon, said the New Year's Eve buffet also included unlimited breadsticks. The Uber ride-hailing service, which has been criticized for charging more during peak periods, earlier this week began bracing customers for surge pricing on the big day. New Year's Eve is the ride service's busiest night of the year, according to a spokeswoman, Molly Spaeth. \"Surge pricing shouldn't be a surprise,\" the company said on its website as of Thursday afternoon. \"Let's toast to you running a fare estimate in the app before you ride.\" Uber has its own unique justification for charging a higher price when demand rises: It helps to attract drivers to offer their services when they are most needed. On an ordinary day, it remains unclear whether surge pricing really entices more drivers to offer rides, according to Chris Nosko, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and co-author of a recent study on Uber's pricing. New Year's Eve might be an exception, though, since drivers might themselves prefer to hang out with friends instead of chauffeuring tipsy, sloppy passengers - unless the price is right. \"I think New Year's is, anecdotally, probably one of the best arguments for surge pricing bringing drivers online,\" he said. In fact, Nosko said he had been watching as drivers discussed their New Year's Eve plans in online forums. \"I have rubber floors and vinyl-covered seats to deal with people who do manage to smuggle in a drink then spill it,\" wrote one poster to uberpeople.net, one of the sites Nosko monitors. Others lamented that the surge pricing on Thursday might not be lucrative enough. \"I made $650 last year,\" wrote one Reddit user who claimed to be a driver in a comment thread about Uber on New Year's Eve. \"Don't expect a repeat of those fantastic results, necessarily, but I'll be chasing that dream again tonight for sure!\" Another poster wrote that a year ago, New Year's Day was more lucrative than New Year's Eve because most of the passengers were \"nicely low-key cause they were all hung over.\" This year, the driver planned to give New Year's Eve a pass, and instead \"go enjoy the eve. with pals.\" Oancea - Vegas Dave, that is - has long done just that, making him a club promoter's dream. New Year's Eve typically followed a pattern: dinner at a nice steakhouse, then a limo to the club, where Vegas Dave said he drank only the finest tequila and Champagne. By 3 or 4 a.m., he and his friends would usually head to an after-hours club, where they would spend another $5,000 to $10,000 before finally growing weary enough to head home around 7 or 8 a.m. \"When I go out,\" he said, \"I go out to go big.\" Not everyone can party like Vegas Dave, although some try. The research firm IBISWorld expects Americans to have spent $26 billion on night life in 2015, and says total revenue has been growing modestly since 2010. Still, the industry has been hampered by shaky consumer confidence after the recession. Much of the revenue growth can be attributed to higher alcohol prices, rather than higher volume, according to IBISWorld's report. The various pressures on the industry have pushed club owners to outdo one another, whether it's an indoor waterfall or live acrobats flying above the dance floor. \"You can no longer be a big black box with a DJ inside,\" said Diaz of the night life association. \"Especially during the holidays, it's all about being over the top.\"                ", "section": "Health", "topics": {"INTERNATIONAL SPORTS": 0.13793103448275862, "INTERNATIONAL ENTERTAINMENT, INTERNATIONAL CELEBRITIES": 0.034482758620689655, "HEALTH AND LIVING": 0.1724137931034483, "STOCK MARKET": 0.13793103448275862, "BUSINESS AND COMPANIES": 0.034482758620689655, "TAX AND SERVICES": 0.10344827586206896, "TRANSPORTATION, ROAD SAFETY": 0.034482758620689655}, "day": 1}

In September parliament in the officially pacifist nation passed security bills opening the door for Japanese troops to engage in combat overseas for the first time since the end of World War II. The legislation was met with strong public resistance at home with tens of thousands taking part in street protests, while also fuelling anger in China and on the Korean peninsula. Critics have warned that the changes could see Japanese troops dragged into far-flung foreign conflicts similar to the US invasions of Iraq or Afghanistan. \"Under the new legislation for peace and security, we will prevent war by taking all possible preparations for any circumstances,\" Abe said in a New Year's message. \"We have successfully built a foundation for handing down a peaceful Japan to the generations of our children and grandchildren.\" Abe's message came a day after China announced it was building its second aircraft carrier, which will have a displacement of 50,000 tonnes and carry China's indigenous J-15 aircraft along with other planes. Beijing has rapidly expanded its military in recent years, rattling its neighbours and attracting the attention of the United States, which is making a foreign policy \"pivot\" towards Asia. Relations between Japan and China -- Asia's two biggest economies -- have often been strained over competing claims of the Senkaku islands, or Diaoyu in Chinese. Last month, a Chinese coast guard ship which appeared to be armed with several cannon entered what Tokyo regards as its territorial waters near the disputed islands. Despite steps to improve ties, distrust remains high as China is wary of moves by Abe to raise Japan's military profile while Tokyo frets about Beijing's increasing regional and global assertiveness. \u00a0                ", "section": "Finance", "topics": {"INTERNATIONAL ISSUES": 0.21212121212121213, "MINISTRY AND DEPARTMENTS, MINISTERS": 0.12121212121212122, "ECONOMIC GROWTH": 0.2727272727272727, "TRENDING ISSUES": 0.12121212121212122}, "day": 1}

It was a roller-coaster ride for the stock market in 2015 where the benchmark Sensex lost 1,381.88 points or 5 per cent, after gaining nearly 30 per cent in 2014. The index had last registered an yearly loss in 2011 when it fell 24 per cent. It also came off sharply after peaking above 30,000-points mark, a milestone it crossed in March but could not retain. Listing out the markets' wishlist for the new year, Bonanza Portfolio's Associate Fund Manager Hiren Dhakan said,\"GST Bill being passed in the Parliament, further rate cuts by RBI, stable Indian rupee against the US dollar, no further devaluation of Chinese Yuan, normal monsoon, fresh policy measures by the government to promote foreign investment and stable oil prices.\" GST, which seeks to simplify and harmonise the indirect tax regime across the country with a single uniform rate, has been stuck for a long time in a political gridlock. \"Passage of the GST bill is likely to be the priority for the government in the new year. Government spending towards infrastructure and ease of doing business will be other wish list which will be keenly watched. As inflation trajectory continues to be low we can expect 2-3 more rate cut decision by RBI during the later part of 2016,\" said Vinod Nair, Head Fundamental Research, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services. \"As far as FIIs flow is concerned, world liquidity hunts for the best opportunities in the market and India is amongst the finest economies in the EMs available at fair valuation,\" Nair said. Last year also saw the worst single-day performance by the Sensex on August 24 when it fell sharply by 1,624.51 points or 5.94 per cent triggered by a Chinese rout. Delay in key reforms including GST, global headwinds and uncertainty about an interest rate hike in the US, had kept the markets on the edge in 2015. \"Passing of key reform bills like Goods and Services Tax (GST), increased capital expenditure by companies, increase in inflow of foreign money, good monsoon, improved macro-economic condition, improvement in consumption demand, strengthening of rupee against dollar,\" said Gaurav Jain, Director of Hem Securities. Analysts said that GST Bill passage and the Union Budget would be the key triggers for Indian markets in the New Year. \"Fed rate hike was already been discounted by the markets hence we have not seen any major volatility in the markets post the US Fed announcement. We do not see any immediate impact of the same, going ahead. Future expectations on rate hikes will be triggered by the data which comes up over the next few months in the US,\" said Kamlesh Rao, CEO of Kotak Securities. 2015 has been extremely eventful for the stock market. The markets hit an all-time high with the Sensex and the Nifty surpassing the 30,000 and 9,000 levels, respectively, despite several odds such as deficient monsoon, shaky global markets and subdued corporate earnings, he added. \"We see the Indian markets gradually gaining steam as earnings numbers of India Inc improve and global market fears fade away. We expect the Sensex to remain in the range of 26,000-29,500 in the year 2016, and Nifty in the range of 8,200-8,900,\" Dhakan said. Krishna Kumar Karwa, MD, Emkay Global Financial Service said, \"In the most likely scenario, earnings growth may still remain modest in 2016, but better than 2015. With state elections lined up in the next 24 months, political developments can also have bearings on market sentiment in short term.\" Market experts said that expectation is bright on the new year. Prospects favor India on hopes of FII inflows returning, an inspiring Budget and corporate earnings reviving with gradual improvement in consumption. \"We expect Sensex to be around 30,000 by end of 2016, a growth of 20 per cent in current level. We believe 2015 was a year of correction for stock markets. We see it as a part of life circle where correction time is repeating itself after two consecutive years. But Indian economy is a success story and Sensex has to see new highs in coming years,\" said Shrey Jain, CEO of SAS Online. \"Some crucial bills are on the table and with the nod in the Parliament, a new growth story is waiting to be written. Majority of the BSE listed companies have indicated that earnings will improve next year, which will set the stage for gains,\" Jain added. On the sectors that are likely to do well in 2016, Dhakan said: \"IT, pharma, FMCG and auto are expected to do well in 2016. IT and pharma are expected to do well on the back of stronger dollar. Auto sector would be the major beneficiary when RBI cuts interest rates further.\"        ", "section": "Finance", "topics": {"BUSINESS PROFIT AND LOSS": 0.09090909090909091, "STOCK MARKET": 0.45454545454545453, "ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY, FINANCE MINISTRY": 0.2727272727272727}, "day": 1}

The messages released Thursay clearly indicate that advisers to Mayor Rahm Emanuel knew within months that the case could be politically explosive. Thousands of emails were released in response to open-records requests from The Associated Press and other media regarding 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, who was killed in October 2014 after being shot 16 times. Few communications from Emanuel's staff mention him directly - though several refer to him by the acronym \"MRE.\" A video of the officer shooting McDonald - which was not made public until more than a year later, on November 24 - led to protests and repeated calls for Emanuel to resign. The officer has been charged with murder and pleaded not guilty this week at his arraignment. Emanuel has denied ever seeing the video prior to its release, a contention many activists have said they do not believe. The emails do not appear to contradict Emanuel's claim, though they show how City Hall grew increasingly concerned that the video could pose a major public-relations problem. In early December 2014, Scott Ando, head of the Independent Police Review Authority - publicly touted by the mayor as uniquely independent in its probes of police shootings - singled out the case. He sent an email to the mayor's deputy chief of staff, Janey Rountree, with a link to a website that raised questions about police accounts of the shooting. Emanuel spokesman Adam Collins sent a flurry of emails about media inquiries into video of the shooting. His subject line on a December 10, 2014, email to fellow Emanuel staffers included the headline in one Chicago newspaper: \"If Chicago police have video of teen shooting, let's see it: advocates.\" The risk that a publicly released video could blow up not just locally but also nationally was made by lawyers from McDonald's family, who reached out to the city about a settlement in early 2015, just over a month before Emanuel's re-election. Although none of the correspondence directly addressed Emanuel, in a letter on March 6 - after the family's lawyers saw the video - attorney Jeffrey J. Neslund told city lawyers that the footage would reflect badly on the city. \"I submit the graphic dash cam video will have a powerful impact on any jury and the Chicago community as a whole,\" he wrote. \"This case will undoubtedly bring a microscope of national attention to the shooting itself as well as the city's pattern, practice and procedures in rubber-stamping fatal police shootings of African Americans as 'justified.'\" He demanded $16 million. The two sides eventually settled on $5 million, a deal approved by the city council shortly after Emanuel won a second term. Though the Independent Police Review Authority, or IPRA, is supposed to maintain a distance from police and the mayor's office, a March 11 email from Ando asks about forwarding witness interview transcripts to the law department \"for their use in settlement negotiations with\" the McDonald family. In May, Collins cautioned IPRA spokesman Larry Merritt to \"tread lightly\" when a reporter asked for an IPRA interview about the case. \"Can anyone do an interview? I think we need to accept some of these opportunities,\" Merritt wrote in a May 26 email to top Emanuel aides and Ando. \"These stories are getting done with or without us.\" Collins responded: \"I completely agree that we need to engage more, but if their focus is on specifics (sic) investigations we should tread very lightly. This is about Laquan McDonald and we should not do interviews about open investigations.\" Also in May, Collins complained to colleagues that IPRA did not follow his recommendation on how to respond to a TV station about McDonald. Days before the video's release, Collins wrote to police and law department representatives urging them to speak with \"one voice\" on the topic. Emanuel and Chicago police have been under heavy scrutiny since the city, under court order, released the squad-car video. McDonald, who was carrying a folded 3-inch knife, is seen veering away from officer Jason Van Dyke in the video before the officer starts firing. The release of the video forced the resignation of Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy and led to an ongoing civil rights investigation of the entire Chicago Police Department by the US Department of Justice. The city released the emails less than a week after police fatally shot two other people: 55-year-old Bettie Jones, who authorities said was killed accidentally, and 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier, who police said was being \"combative.\" Both were black. \u00a0                ", "section": "Entertainment", "topics": {"INTERNATIONAL ENTERTAINMENT, INTERNATIONAL CELEBRITIES": 0.21739130434782608, "POLICE": 0.17391304347826086, "TRENDING ISSUES": 0.17391304347826086, "ENTERTAINMENT": 0.021739130434782608, "GOVERNMENT, GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS": 0.08695652173913043, "CRIME": 0.21739130434782608}, "day": 1}

In a letter to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu cited the prevailing financial position of railways, efforts at cost cutting and possible gradual adjustment of fares and other non-tariff revenue measures to absorb the impact while requesting the exchequer's help for implementation of the Commission recommendations. \"I would therefore earnestly request you to help the Ministry of Railways and handhold it for the implementation of 7th CPC recommendations,\" the Railway Minister said in the letter. \"This may be done either through compensation of loss for coaching services (Rs 31,727 crore in 2013-14) or directly by virtue of a revenue grant, matching the amount of the 7th CPC's liability placed upon railways for the next 3-4 years,\" he said. Mr Prabhu hoped that during this 3-4 years period, railways would be able to absorb the impact from their resources through gradual adjustment of fares and other non-tariff revenue measures. However, Railway Minister has expressed his reservation about increasing the freight rate in the given scenario contending that it would have a \"deleterious impact\" on national economy. He said, \"In order to maintain these expenses at the current proportion - at 51.5 per cent of the gross receipts, the railway revenues will need to grow substantially by 40 per cent in 2016-17 which is well nigh impossible given the fact that till October 2015 growth was only 8.4 per cent.\" \"The first factor of freight earnings originating loading is demand driven and is largely not within the control of railways. The second factor that is freight rates, though is within railways competence, there is hardly any headroom available for increasing the same without affecting railways competitiveness adversely.\" He said, \"Moreover, exercising this option will have a deleterious impact on the national economy as well as on critical sectors such as coal, cement, foodgrains.\" According to the Pay Commission report, the annual financial impact on Railways will be approximately Rs 28,450 crore in addition to the normal growth which will require to be built into the Railway Budget 2016-17. \u00a0\"Our initial assessment however is that this additional impact would be around Rs 30,031 crore over and above the normal assessed growth of Rs 10,816 crore,\" Railway Minister stated. Mr Prabhu has pointed out that the Railways bear 35.6 per cent of the total pay and allowances of the government which is more than 1/3rd of the Pay Commission's burden for serving staff would be borne by railways. \"Further nearly 28 per cent of the pension impact of central government would be on the Railways,\" the letter sent last week said. Currently, pay & allowances and pension account for 51.5 per cent of the gross receipts of railways. With the financial impact of the 7th CPC, this will increase to 68 per cent of the gross receipts in 2016-17 at present level of growth. Mr Prabhu has also mentioned the details about the cost cutting measures in railways. \"While we have put in place serious cost cutting measures and are focusing on fuel management and lowering of staff intake, more than 2.3rd of the railway expenditure is inelastic - staff cost, pension, lease charges, maintenance of fixed assets.\" Mr Prabhu has sent a detailed note along with the letter on the Railways financial position vis-a-vis impact of 7th CPC's recommendation.

At the same time, the existing public and private sector banks would also have to prove their competitiveness in the wake of two entirely new breeds of banks joining the fray in the form of payments and small finance banks this year. At the end of the day, it will be the customers and the quality of services offered to them that will matter and the bankers are almost unanimous that the technology is going to remain the key plank for the banking sector going ahead. ICICI Bank's CEO Chanda Kochhar said the financial sector will see continued innovations based on technology that will deliver enhanced convenience and value to customers. But it is the technology that the new entrants with payments bank license are looking to tap for making a mark in the $1.5 trillion banking industry and to challenge the traditional banking models. State-run SBI's chief Arundhati Bhattacharya, known for being vocal with her views, said the new 'agile' players may have an edge as they are not bound by industry-level wage agreements which can lead to \"a dog-eat-dog's world\". \"Existing universal banks stand to face challenges given the fact that these banks will be coming in without any risk, that they will be coming in with an agile system and delivery models and that they have not been held hostage by industry-level agreements and wage limits,\" she said. Another key issue for the banks in the New Year would be RBI's new diktat for following a uniform method for setting their base lending rates, which follows Governor Raghuram Rajan repeatedly chiding the bankers to ensure passing on full benefits of the central bank's repo rate cuts to customers. Banks have so far been known to have been slow in passing on the rate cut benefits, although the hikes in RBI's policy rate get passed on immediately. A sense of unease is there among the bankers on this, but not many of them have spoken out publicly on this, again sans the SBI chief, who said that RBI's repo rate was a \"blunt instrument\" and not very relevant for lenders to adjust their rates. While such run-ins are expected to continue between the banks and the central bank this year, Rajan has shown no signs of relenting on the deadline of March 2017 given to the banks to clean up their balance sheets and banks are most likely to be supportive of his measures in the fight against bad loans, which is estimated to have ballooned to Rs 4 lakh crore or about $60 billion. In the recently released Financial Stability Report, RBI said as of September quarter, led by state-run banks, gross NPAs rose to 5.1 per cent from 4.6 per cent in March 2015, while net NPAs increased to 2.8 per cent from 2.5 per cent during the same period taking the total stressed assets to 11.1 per cent. \"...one of the possible inferences (for rising NPAs) could be that banks extended disproportionately high levels of credit to corporate entities/promoters who had much less 'skin in the game' during the boom period,\" it said. NPAs may rise further in the initial months of 2016 as the RBI has reportedly identified top 150 defaulters and asked banks to make additional provisions for those loans. In this fight, one big achievement last year for banks was that they managed to declare many defaulters like Kingfisher Airlines, Winsome Diamonds, Zoom Developers among others, as willful defaulters. With rising NPAs, banks' profitability continues to take a hit with the state-run banks posting a 19 per cent dip in profits for the second quarter of the current fiscal, although private sector banks managed to log in a 15 per cent growth. The FSR has also warned that default by three top corporates could shave off 13 per cent of the bank capital. Default by two of the highly leveraged corporates can result in capital losses of 9 per cent and 13 per cent losses can occur if the top three borrowers default, warns the report. \"Corporate sector vulnerabilities and the impact of their weak balance sheets on the financial system need closer monitoring,\" Governor Rajan said in the report. The report also notes that contribution of large borrowers to total bad loans and restructured accounts, which crossed 11.1 per cent of the system, is a whopping 87 per cent as of the September quarter, up from 78.2 per cent a year ago. \"Asset quality and capital are the two important factors for the banking sector and some new beginnings have been made on those fronts. However, the pace of reforms is still slow,\" Icra senior vice-president Vibha Batra said. Worried over the rising tide of bad loans, Rajan in the December policy announcement set a deadline to state-run banks to clean up their bloated balance-sheets by FY17. The government on the other hand has been taking a number of steps to revive the health of public sector lenders. At the same time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it clear that the 'lazy banking' must come to an end, as he asked bankers to run the banks professionally without any outside influence. The RBI has also given the banks more tools to speed up recovery from stressed assets in the form of strategic debt restructuring, which allows banks to convert a part their debt into equity of defaulting firms.

Taking note, the Election Commission asked the state chief secretary to \"urgently\" institute a \"suitable enquiry\" into the issue. Chhattisgarh Congress issued a show-cause notice to Amit and decided to wait for a report from the state unit before taking any action against Ajit Jogi since he is a member of the Congress Working Committee, the party's top decision making body. Besides, shortfall in rains leading to drought in 117 tehsils and farmers' suicides also made news in 2015. On February 12, the ACB conducted simultaneous raids at 28 premises of the civil supplies department and unearthed disproportionate assets worth Rs 7 crore, apart from recovering cash worth over Rs 3 crore. Cases were registered against 28 people under IPC sections 109 (abetment), 120(b) (criminal conspiracy) and other relevant sections of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The Raman Singh government remained busy warding off the Opposition attack over the issue as the Congress demanded a CBI probe. Meanwhile, a series of Naxal incidents rocked the state in April, including the killing of seven Special Task Force (STF) men in Polampalli police station area of Sukma district. On April 11, a large group of armed cadres ambushed a team of STF in Pidmel village, about 450 km from the state capital, killing seven of them. The next day, on April 12, a BSF jawan was killed when Naxals opened indiscriminate fire on security personnel patrolling in the proximity of Chhote Baithiya Border Security Force camp under Bande police station in Kanker district.

The recent killings of three engineers has led to a war of words that contrasts sharply with the unity the two leaders projected during the November poll campaign, against the BJP's charges of \"jungle raj\" or lawlessness in Bihar. On Tuesday, Lalu Yadav said that the Nitish Kumar government must be \"more vigilant\" on law and order. \"If anyone receives any extortion call then please call me and I will ensure speedy action,\" said the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief. A senior leader of his party, Raghubansh Prasad Singh, yesterday went further and said \"Nitish Kumar, who is sitting on the driver's seat of the government, should initiate stern measures to check the further slide.\" Nitish Kumar has been silent till now but his party has reacted sharply. \"Nitish Kumar does not need any lecture from anyone. His track record is known,\" said Janata Dal United spokesperson Sanjay Kumar Singh. Exactly a year ago, Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav's joint appearance at a rally signaled their reunion after 20 years of bitter political enmity. The two leaders set aside deep differences to take on a common enemy, the BJP, in the assembly polls. After their sensational victory, Lalu Yadav stayed out of the government but his two sons Tejaswi and Tej Pratap, both debutants, took two of the most important spots in the Nitish Kumar cabinet. The coalition faces its biggest challenge after the murder of the engineers and a businessman recently. The BJP has held up the incidents as an example of the return of \"jungle raj\". A senior Janata Dal United leader, Shyam Rajak, said it was Nitish Kumar who had pulled Bihar out of perceived lawlessness. The period from 1990 to 2005, when Lalu Yadav's party was in power, is often described by the opposition as the most lawless period in the state in recent times.

The change, which was announced in October by the ruling Communist Party, takes effect from January 1, 2016, Beijing's official Xinhua news agency reported over the weekend. The \"one child policy\", instituted in the late 1970s, restricted most couples to only a single offspring through a system of fines for violators and even forced abortions. For years, authorities argued that it was a key contributor to China's economic boom and had prevented 400 million births. Rural families were allowed two children if the first was a girl, while ethnic minorities were allowed an extra offspring, leading some to dub it a \"one-and-a-half child\" policy. But it also led to heart-rending tales of loss for would-be parents, and prompted sex-selective abortions or infanticide targeting girls because of a centuries-old social preference for boys. China's population -- the world's largest at 1.37 billion -- is now ageing rapidly and has severe gender imbalances, all while the country's workforce is shrinking. Under the new law, married couples are now allowed to have a second child, but the legislation maintains limits on additional births. Around three million extra babies will be born each year over the next five years as a result, officials from the National Health and Family Planning Commission predicted at a briefing in November. This would add a total of about 30 million people to the labour force by 2050, officials said. Still, experts say the shift is likely too little, too late to address China's looming population crisis. Others warn that many Chinese couples do not want more children, particularly given the expense, and the effects of the change remain unclear. \u00a0                ", "section": "Government", "topics": {"ECONOMIC GROWTH": 0.2777777777777778, "GOVERNMENT, GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS": 0.3055555555555556, "CRIME": 0.1388888888888889}, "day": 1}

Researchers from Duke University in US used CRISPR to treat an adult mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. They had previously used CRISPR to correct genetic mutations in cultured cells from Duchenne patients, and other labs had corrected genes in single-cell embryos in a laboratory environment. But the latter approach is currently unethical to attempt in humans, and the former faces many obstacles in delivering treated cells back to muscle tissues. Another approach, which involves taking CRISPR directly to the affected tissues through gene therapy techniques, also faces challenges, particularly with delivery. Researchers including Aravind Asokan, associate professor at the University of North Carolina, overcame several of these obstacles by using a non-pathogenic carrier called adeno-associated virus, or AAV, to deliver the gene-editing system. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by problems with the body's ability to produce dystrophin, a long protein chain that binds the interior of a muscle fibre to its surrounding support structure. Dystrophin is coded by a gene containing 79 protein-coding regions, called exons. If any one exon gets a debilitating mutation, the chain does not get built. Without dystrophin providing support, muscle tends to shred and slowly deteriorate. Duchenne affects one in 5,000 newborn males. Most patients are wheelchair-bound by age 10 and do not live beyond their 20s or early 30s, the researchers said. The mutation is on the X chromosome so female children with two X chromosomes should have at least one functioning copy of the gene. \"A major hurdle for gene editing is delivery. We know what genes need to be fixed for certain diseases, but getting the gene editing tools where they need to go is a huge challenge,\" said Chris Nelson from Duke University who led the work. \"The best way we have to do it right now is to take advantage of viruses, because they have spent billions of years evolving to figure out how to get their own viral genes into cells,\" Nelson said. To use viruses as delivery vehicles for gene therapy, researchers take all the harmful and replicative genes out of the virus and put in the therapeutic genes they want to deliver. AAV is in use in many late-stage clinical trials in the US, and has already been approved for use in one gene therapy drug in the European Union. There are also different versions of AAV that can preferentially go to different tissues, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle, so researchers can deliver them systemically. The study was published in the journal Science.                ", "section": "Health", "topics": {"HEALTH AND LIVING": 0.7777777777777778}, "day": 1}

Eighty percent of the country's 100 million people are Catholic but Filipino superstition dictates making ear-shattering noises during New Year's Eve to ward off bad luck. Revellers set off firecrackers and shoot guns into the air to celebrate the December festive season. The health department listed 380 injuries due to fireworks and four others due to stray bullets. In many hospitals across the country, firecracker victims rushed into emergency rooms grimacing in pain as they held their bloodied limbs. An eight-year-old boy in the northern farming province of Nueva Vizcaya had three of his fingers amputated after a firecracker exploded in his hands, Garin said. At least nine children had their fingers amputated due to firecracker injuries, she said.

A 65-year-old woman died from a heart attack as she watched her house burn, Yu said. Many Filipino civilians keep licensed guns in their homes to protect themselves in a high-crime society and most firecrackers are legal and easily available.

While the goal of polio virus eradication is in sight, there are concerns about post-eradication manufacturing and stockpiling vaccine stores containing live virus that could escape and repopulate the environment. \"We have developed new strains for IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) production with negligible risk to the human population should they escape\", said the researchers. The attributes of the new strains \"allow for safe vaccine production in the post-eradication world,\" the study noted. Different types of polio vaccines currently exist, but none are optimal from a safety point of view, the researchers from National Institute for Biological Standards and Control in Hertfordshire, Britain, noted. Live attenuated (weakened) vaccine strains carry genetic mutations that prevent them from causing disease, but they can - in rare cases - revert to more dangerous (or virulent) virus. After eradication, the World Health Organisation plans to stop the use of live-attenuated polio vaccines, the study said. In addition, to improve safety, WHO has strongly encouraged new manufacturers to switch the source of inactivated virus from virulent wild-type strains to an attenuated strain, named after the polio vaccine pioneer Sabin. The researchers started with a Sabin vaccine strain and modified a particular region of the viral RNA in ways that they predicted would make the resulting strains genetically stable (i.e. they would not revert to wild-type or other virulent forms). They then compared these new strains with both the original Sabin vaccine strain and the wild-type strain currently used in the production of inactivated vaccine. Besides testing the genetic stability of the new strains, the researchers examined their ability to grow in tissue culture (necessary for vaccine production), their risk for causing paralysis in mice engineered to carry a human polio-virus receptor, and whether--after inactivation--they effectively immunized rats. In all these tests, the new strains behaved as predicted, that is, they are effective, suitable to mass production, and safer than the alternatives.

An auditor's report had said the Congress bent rules to enable windfall gains for Mr Vadra's company. The report was ignored by the Bhupinder Hooda-led government, which set up its own inquiry and then charge-sheeted Mr Khemka for \"causing damage to Mr Vadra's reputation\" and \"illegally\" cancelling the deal. The BJP, which took power in Haryana in October 2014, came out in Mr Khemka's support while targeting Mr Vadra and the Congress.

Although the genetic cause of DMD has been known for nearly 30 years, no effective treatments exist. The disease breaks down muscle fibres and replaces them with fibrous or fatty tissue, causing the muscle to gradually weaken. This condition often results in heart muscle disease, or cardiomyopathy, the leading cause of death in these patients. For the study, the researchers used a gene-editing approach to permanently correct the DMD mutation that causes the disease in young mice. \"This is different from other therapeutic approaches, because it eliminates the cause of the disease,\" said senior author Eric Olson from University of Texas Southwestern Medical Centre in the US. In 2014, Olson's team first used this technique - called CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing - to correct the mutation in the germ line of mice and prevent muscular dystrophy. This paved the way for novel genome editing-based therapeutics in DMD. It also raised several challenges for clinical applications of gene editing. Since germ line editing is not feasible in humans, strategies would need to be developed to deliver gene-editing components to postnatal tissues. To test this out, researchers delivered gene-editing components to the mice via adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9). DMD mice treated with this technique produced dystrophin protein and progressively showed improved structure and function of skeletal muscle and heart. \"This study represents a very important translational application of genome editing of DMD mutations in young mice. It is a solid step toward a practical cure for DMD,\" Rhonda Bassel-Duby, professor at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Centre, noted. \"Importantly, in principle, the same strategy can be applied to numerous types of mutations within the human DMD patients,\" Olson said.

The order of the single bench has been stayed or suspended today by two judge bench. The earlier order had been challenged by a leader of BJP,\u00a0 which governs the state in coalition with the People's Democratic Body or PDP. Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the oath-taking ceremony of the new government on 1st March last year; both flags were used at the ceremony. All the ministers also took oath of allegiance to J&K constitution. Reacting to the order today, the PDP said, \"We don't need a judgement to hoist or 'unhoist' state flag. Court and legislature is duty bound to ensure the sanctity of state flag. State and national flag is not in conflict with each other.\" \u00a0 Jammu and Kashmir is the only Indian state permitted to fly its own state flag along with the national flag. The judges that asked for the state flag to be used had said their decision was based on Article 370 of the Constitution, which grants special status to Jammu and Kashmir and allows it to make its own laws in areas barring some like defence. \u00a0 The state's constitution makes it mandatory for the national and state flag to be used together. In March, the government issued a notice saying both flags must be used, creating a rift between senior partner the PDP and the BJP. To bridge the gap, the instruction was then withdrawn, with the understanding that the state's constitution provides for both flags to be used and therefore, special instructions are not needed. \u00a0 \u00a0 \"The state flag has the same sanctity and position as the Union flag has under the Indian Constitution and other statutory provisions. Therefore, this sanctity and position has to be maintained at all costs,\" the judges had on December 18. Former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah tweeted: Here's what I'll say - so long as J&K is a part of India the two flags will continue to fly & we'll take pride in it  https://t.co/BSpKxIhb86 - Omar Abdullah (@abdullah_omar)  January 1, 2016", "section": "Crime, Law and Order", "topics": {"TRANSPORTATION, ROAD SAFETY": 0.09523809523809523, "ECONOMIC GROWTH": 0.047619047619047616, "LAW, COURTS, TRIBUNAL": 0.23809523809523808}, "day": 1}

Promises of government jobs, infrastructure were premised on high growth of GDP. None of the promises have materialized. On the contrary 2015 has ended in a subdued note. GDP is not likely to be higher than 7-7.5 per cent. Which means it will be the same as or less than 2014-15 It is stuck in a groove. Economy is a car running on two wheels. Exports are in 12 successive months of decline compared to the previous year. This is unprecedented. Acute distress in rural India especially in farm sector. Rural wage growth neutral. MSP deliberately kept low. Net sown area Rabi is lower than last year Downside risks to agricultural production this year. Just travel to rural India and talk to farmers. Deep resentment of tardy implementation on MGNREGA. Crop insurance unavailable. Old age pension scheme severely pruned Education loans practically stopped. Demand for security. People are unable to point to any scheme. Anger and angst of rural India is reflected in recent elections in GJ, CG and MP Urban India is not much better. Food transport electricity and water. Increase in crime, lack of jobs and growing intolerance has caused much grief.

While the buying trends during 2015 witnessed a significant upward movement due to aggressive online discounts, rising fuel prices and wider and abundant choice will hit the e-commerce industry in 2016, it pointed out. On the other hand, mobile commerce (m-commerce) is growing rapidly as a stable and secure supplement to the e-commerce industry. Shopping online through smartphones is proving to be a game changer, and industry leaders believe that m-commerce could contribute up to 70 per cent of their total revenues. The paper reveals that Mumbai ranks first in online shopping followed by Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru and Kolkata. The study also noted that one out of three customers currently makes transactions through mobiles in Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities. \"In 2015, 78 per cent of shopping queries were made through mobile devices, compared to 46 per cent in 2013,\" Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat said. In 2015, the highest growth rate was seen in the apparel segment, almost 69.5 per cent over last year, followed by electronic items, up 62 per cent, baby care products, up 53 per cent, beauty and personal care products at 52 per cent and home furnishings at 49 per cent. Rapid growth of digital commerce in India is mainly due to increased use of smartphones. Mobiles and mobile accessories have taken up the maximum share of the digital commerce market in India, noted the study. Moreover, almost 45 per cent online shoppers reportedly preferred cash on delivery over credit cards (16 per cent) and debit cards (21 per cent). Only 10 per cent opted for internet banking and a scanty 7 per cent preferred cash cards, mobile wallets, and other such modes of payment. The 18-25 years of age group has been the fastest growing age segment online with user growth being contributed by both male and female segments. The survey highlights that 38 per cent of regular shoppers are in 18-25 age group, 52 per cent in 26-35, 8 per cent in 36-45 and 2 per cent in the age group of 45-60. Nearly 65 per cent online shoppers are male and 35 per cent female.

The huge blaze at The Address Downtown hotel erupted around 9:30 pm (1730 GMT) on Thursday, sparking panic but no reports of serious injuries. Authorities went ahead with a dazzling fireworks display at the nearby Burj Khalifa -- the world's tallest skyscraper -- despite the inferno, the latest in a series of fires in recent years to hit the buildings that make up Dubai's futuristic cityscape. Officials have said the fire erupted from the outside of the building on its 20th floor but the exact cause was not yet known. A top Dubai security official, General Dahi Khalfan, posted a picture on Twitter of a fire beneath a ledge of the building, saying the start of the blaze had been captured by a police criminal investigation photographer. \"This is where the search begins,\" Khalfan wrote of the picture, which appeared to show a lower portion of the building. Witnesses described scenes of panic after the fire spread, with residents screaming and some fainting as they rushed to evacuate the building. Still, authorities said only 16 people had suffered mostly minor injuries. At least 14 people were slightly injured, one was moderately injured and one person suffered a heart attack during the evacuation, the government said. Firefighters spent the night trying to extinguish the blaze. 'Residents Open Homes' Heavy black smoke still billowed from several floors of the hotel early on Friday, an AFP photographer said, as firefighters continued to douse the building with water hoses. Roads leading directly to the hotel were closed but otherwise Dubai city centre appeared normal, with passers-by stopping to take pictures of the building with their mobile phones. The hashtag #NeedanAddress trended on Twitter overnight as Dubai residents offered to open their homes to evacuated hotel guests. \"We have sofas, sleeping bags and an endless supply of love. Plus Nutella. #needanaddress #mydubai You're not alone. You're home,\" resident Faizan Jamal Tweeted. \"This #NeedanAddress thing is awesome. Good going, Dubai,\" Omar Adam wrote. Many on Twitter praised the response of fire and emergency services, pointing to the fact that there were no major injuries, though some questioned whether New Year's festivities should have gone ahead. \"Bizarre response of authorities in Dubai. Surely fireworks could have waited till tomorrow?\" Sumbal Naqi wrote. The Dubai government said evacuated guests were being offered alternative accommodation and provided a telephone number to call for assistance. It published several videos on its Twitter feed of fireworks erupting around the iconic Burj Khalifa and said the New Year's celebration was a testimony to Dubai's \"steadfast commitment to its major projects and initiatives\". 'Trapped On Ledge' A newspaper photographer who was on a 48th floor to take pictures of the fireworks when the fire erupted told AFP he had spent a harrowing 30 minutes standing on a ledge outside the building, only metres from the raging blaze. The photographer, who asked not to be named, said he was trapped on a balcony by fire and smoke. Unable to escape and afraid he would die of suffocation, he rolled out some 30 metres (100 feet) of heavy-duty cable from a nearby machine used by workers to clean the tower's windows, attached it to his belt and stepped off the balcony onto a narrow ledge. \"One hour, then that's it, I'm dead,\" he thought as he stood on the ledge. He was eventually saved by rescue workers after calling and texting colleagues asking for help. The Address Downtown hotel, opened in May 2008 and owned by Dubai property giant Emaar's hospitality group, is the 18th tallest building in the city and the 93rd highest in the world. A growing tourist destination, Dubai has become famed in recent years for its distinctive skyline and ambitious building projects, but has suffered from a number of spectacular fires. In November, a massive blaze engulfed three residential blocs in central Dubai and led to services on a metro line being suspended, although no one was hurt. In February, a huge fire gutted one of the emirate's tallest buildings, destroying luxury flats in the Torch tower and triggering an evacuation of nearby blocs in the Dubai Marina neighbourhood. In 2012, a massive blaze gutted the 34-storey Tamweel Tower in the nearby Jumeirah Lake Towers district. It was later revealed to have been caused by a cigarette butt thrown into a bin. \u00a0                ", "section": "Infrastructure", "topics": {"TRANSPORTATION, ROAD SAFETY": 0.7073170731707317, "AVIATION, AIRPORTS": 0.024390243902439025, "GOVERNMENT, GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS": 0.024390243902439025, "LAW, COURTS, TRIBUNAL": 0.024390243902439025, "BUSINESS AND COMPANIES": 0.024390243902439025}, "day": 1}

Last month, CCI had announced that it has given decisions on 29 combination cases during December, highest ever during any given month. CCI has the mandate to keep a tab on unfair business practices across sectors, while mergers and acquisitions beyond a certain threshold also require its approval. So far, the commission has dealt with more than 300 cases related to mergers and acquisitions. In a tweet on Friday, CCI said it has \"received 127 combination cases in 2015 -- highest number of cases received so far in a calendar year\". In July, CCI had revised its combination regulations as part of efforts to make the process simpler and more transparent. According to the regulator, the amendments provide greater clarity and certainty with respect to Merger and Acquisition\u00a0(M&A) filings and will help in avoiding undue delays in the approval process. Among the combination decisions given this year are approval of IndusInd Bank's acquisition of gem and jewellery portfolio of Royal Bank of Scotland, acquisition of 26.33 per cent share capital of Tata Projects by Tata Capital and Omega, and acquisition of iGate by Capgemini. Also, merger of retail store and retail infrastructure businesses of Future Retail and Bharti Retail got CCI's approval along with acquisition of additional 23 per cent equity of Aviva Life Insurance Company by Aviva International Holdings. Among others, Pfizer-Vidhi Research deal and acquisition of Piramal Enterprises' lab diagnostics and point-of-care business by DiaSys India also got the regulators' nod. The regulator also gave its green signal to acquisition of wealth management business of RBS by Sanctum Wealth and the acquisition of animal health business of Novartis by Eli Lilly. CCI also introduced electronic filing facility last month, making it simpler for entities to submit information related to mergers and acquisitions (M&A). In August, CCI Chairman Ashok Chawla had said that there was at least 15-20 per cent increase in filings. M&A filings for this year are likely to be 20 per cent more than the previous year, he had said. CCI Member Augustine Peter had also said in November that there has been an increasing trend in combination filings in the recent past, which indicates that investors are increasingly turning positive about the Indian economy.

The six Central para- military forces will be putting up only 3 marching contingents instead of one contingent each. The fly-past by the IAF, however, has been retained.

A probe by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) found that there was transfer of funds between the client bank account maintained by Anand Rathi Share and bank accounts of Anand Rathi Commodities. Anand Rathi Commodities is a group company of Anand Rathi\u00a0Share, which deals in commodities market. The markets regulator said that Anand Rathi Share has completely stopped the practice of funds transfer of clients across the company of Anand Rathi Share to Anand Rathi Commodities since April 21, 2014 and it has even changed its inter-segment and inter-company transfer of funds policy. In the present case, Sebi said there were 21,198 instances amounting to Rs 220 crore of transfer of funds (payments and\u00a0receipts) between Anand Rathi Share's client bank account and\u00a0Anand Rathi Commodities during the financial year 2012-13. Out of these fund transfers, there were a total of 11,220 instances, amounting to Rs 119 crore, of payments made from Anand Rathi Share's client bank account to Anand Rathi Commodities. In 9,973 cases, a total of Rs 101 crore were received in Anand Rathi Share's client bank account from Anand Rathi Commodities. The brokerage firm said that funds were transferred from/to commodities account to securities account to facilitate the client and fulfill his obligation in respective segment for the ease of operation to client who was trading across various segments. The markets watchdog Sebi said that Anand Rathi Share has\u00a0followed the practice of transfer of funds between commodities\u00a0and securities broking companies on a frequent and regular\u00a0basis. \"If argument put forward by the notice (Anand Rathi Share) that the said transfers are executed with client's consent is accepted, it will also convey a wrong message to the market participants that this practice has been regularised. This may also have wider implications from systemic point of view,\" Sebi said in an order. By indulging in such activities, Anand Rathi Share has failed to exercise 'due skill and care' in conduct of its business and has failed to comply with statutory requirements under Sebi (Stock-Brokers & Sub-Brokers) Regulations. Accordingly, Sebi has imposed a \"monetary penalty of Rs 30 lakh on the noticee which will be commensurate with the default committed by it.\"        ", "section": "Finance", "topics": {"BUSINESS PROFIT AND LOSS": 0.21428571428571427, "TAX AND SERVICES": 0.5714285714285714, "STOCK MARKET": 0.07142857142857142, "PUBLIC FIGURES": 0.07142857142857142}, "day": 1}

Sit up!\" Ding Xinfeng's eyes blinked open. Dawn had yet to break, but inside a 24-hour McDonald's restaurant in central Beijing, more than a dozen homeless people had begun their daily routines. Mr. Ding lifted his head, revealing a mess of food stains and decorative slogans on the table in front of him. \"Wake up every morning with the thought that something wonderful is about to happen,\" one read. Mr. Ding could not read the English, but he said he liked the warmth of this table, in this corner, in the peace of McDonald's, the place he had called home for several years. Every night across East Asia, in major cities like Beijing, Hong Kong and Tokyo, an invisible class of people - shut out of shelter systems, scorned by their families, down on their luck - turn to a beacon of Americana for a warm, dry place to sleep. \u00a0 A McDonald's in Hong Kong. Many homeless people say they have no choice but to stay at McDonald's, given a dearth of shelter options and the stigma of sleeping on the street. \u00a0 By day, the McDonald's restaurants host birthday parties and book clubs. By night, when the floors have been mopped a final time and the pop music turned down, they become sanctuaries for the downtrodden, who pounce on half-eaten hamburgers and stale French fries, and stake out prized sleeping spots in padded booths. Often called McRefugees, they vanish at sunrise, some combing their hair with plastic forks before slinking outside into the masses. On an austere November morning, as the wind howled outside, Mr. Ding's McDonald's began to fill up with schoolchildren, yam sellers, retirees armed with chess pieces and red-eyed street patrolmen. He began to circle, making his pitch for donations. \"My family has begged for food since the Ming dynasty,\" he said. \"I'm the 19th generation. There will be no beggars in China after I'm dead.\" A man offered a newspaper. A woman gave 50 cents. A young girl extended a French fry. Mr. Ding returned to his seat, opened the newspaper, and began studying the lottery numbers, searching for patterns. While other restaurants might kick them out, McDonald's generally embraces wanderers like Mr. Ding, who have flocked to the chain as it has rolled out more 24-hour locations in Asia. More than half of the 2,200 McDonald's restaurants in mainland China are now open 24 hours a day. McDonald's has spent decades cultivating an image of community here, building bright, stylish restaurants and adjusting menus to local tastes. In addition to the standard burgers and fries, the Beijing outlets serve taro pies and soy milk with fried bread. Many restaurants have become neighborhood institutions, symbols of status and cleanliness, popular spots for study groups, business meetings and leisurely chats. \"McDonald's welcomes everyone to visit our restaurants anytime,\" said Regina Hui, a spokeswoman for McDonald's in China. How welcoming is up to each franchise owner, the company says. \"We are definitely a welcoming place, but I wouldn't call it a policy,\" Becca Hary, a spokeswoman at the company's headquarters in Oak Brook, Ill., wrote in an email. \u00a0 A woman sleeping at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Hong Kong in October. Across East Asia, 24-hour McDonald's have become a sanctuary for the downtrodden, providing a warm, dry place to sleep. Tension over when that welcome is overstayed has long been an issue for McDonald's around the world. In 2014, a McDonald's in New York City called the police to remove a group of older Korean patrons who had turned the restaurant into a social club, spending more time than money. And a McDonald's in Manchester, England, came under fire last year for refusing to serve a customer who wore dirty clothing, thinking he was homeless. In Hong Kong, Stevix Ho, a McDonald's manager, said he had to contend with a crowd of heroin addicts and people who appeared to have severe mental illness. \"We can't kick them out,\" he said. \"We can only ask them to go away.\" Many homeless people say they have little choice, given a dearth of shelter options and the stigma of sleeping on the street. In mainland China, the government allows homeless people to stay in shelters for a maximum of 10 days. Yip Hin-ming, 57, arrived in Hong Kong four decades ago, drawn by stories of neon lights and clanking factories. In April, after two decades of working as a painter, he had to quit when the pain of a job-related arm injury became overwhelming. \"That was the end,\" he said. \"I was no longer capable.\" He packed a bag with a toothbrush and toilet paper, and found a quiet spot under paintings of onions and tomatoes in a McDonald's in Kowloon, Hong Kong. One day, he said he was startled to learn that a homeless woman at a McDonald's across town had died. She had sat hunched over a table for 24 hours, covered by a gray overcoat, before anyone noticed. \"Nobody knows who we are when we're living, and nobody cares about us when we die,\" Mr. Yip said. \"We're invisible.\" Chan Wai-kwan, 63, a former janitor who had been living at McDonald's from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. every day for three years, said Hong Kong had lost its sense of humanity. \"You'll tell my family if anything happens to me, right?\" he asked, turning to Mr. Yip. \"You'll make sure they know if I die?\" Mr. Yip nodded, but looked despondent. \u00a0 A McDonald's in Hong Kong. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s welcomes everyone to visit our restaurants any time,\u201d said a spokeswoman for McDonald\u2019s in China, though how welcoming is up to each franchise owner. \"My family doesn't know about my life here, and I wouldn't want to tell them,\" he said. \"It's too miserable.\" In addition to the daily quest for food and the requisite but demeaning panhandling, the nighttime residents of McDonald's struggle with perceptions that they are lazy and dishonest. Restaurant staff members sometimes frown at their behavior. \"They can find jobs. They're just too lazy to look,\" said a Beijing McDonald's employee, Mrs. Chen, who asked to be identified only by her family name because she was not authorized to speak with the news media. \"They're driving away customers because they smell so bad.\" Zhang Wei, 56, a vegetable seller who had lost her teeth, said she longed for a normal life but was ostracized by her family. \"How nice it would be to be able to cook and eat at your own home,\" she said. \"You could have your own dumplings and buns and sleep in your own bed. If you don't have money, you can barely sleep.\" Mr. Ding had a reputation at McDonald's as a gadfly. He had a habit of offering loud, indelicate social commentary, telling government workers they were corrupt and men in suits they were greedy. He does work, however. Most days, he leaves McDonald's around 8 a.m. to comb trash cans and bins in back alleys for scraps of copper and steel, which he sells to a friend for 80 cents apiece. He returns by suppertime, waiting for customers to abandon their leftover fries and smoothies. \"This is my work, this is my way of living,\" he said. \"I have no way out.\" He joked about selling his eyeballs, or moving to America, where he had heard they treat the homeless better. And he continued to study the lottery, jotting down long strings of numbers. He calculated his odds at 1 in 10 million. No matter, he said. \"I came into the world naked, and I leave naked,\" he said. \"There's nothing I can take with me when I die.\" \u00a0                ", "section": "Weather", "topics": {"WEATHER, CALAMITIES": 0.14285714285714285, "GOVERNMENT, GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS": 0.03571428571428571, "BUSINESS AND COMPANIES": 0.07142857142857142, "CRIME": 0.07142857142857142, "INTERNATIONAL ISSUES": 0.07142857142857142, "ECONOMIC GROWTH": 0.10714285714285714}, "day": 1}

The comments and suggestion on the above draft guidance may now be sent by January 9, 2016,\" the ministry said in a statement. The draft PoEM guidelines have suggested two-stage process for determining the place of effective management of a company, with a view to assess its tax liability. According to the draft guidelines, the first stage would be identification of the persons who make the key management and commercial decision for the company and secondly the determination of the place where these decisions are made. The modification of the existing norms, it said, is necessary as many companies skip tax liability by misusing the guidelines. Under the existing norms, many companies \"artificially escape\" the residential status under these provisions by shifting insignificant or isolated events related with control and management outside India. The draft norms say PoEM would mean a place where key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the\u00a0conduct of a business or an entity as a whole are in substance\u00a0made.

But the reduction in PM 2.5, possibly around 15 per cent due to less emissions and vehicular dust reduction, that was observed for few hours could be seen as an impact of the odd-even measure as other factors like wind speed and temperature remained the same as last two days,\" Mr Beig told Press Trust of India. However, the jump that was seen afterward need to be examined scientifically and it was possibly due to a sudden dip in the day time temperature. Cooler temperature heightens pollution. \"It is still premature to conclude anything with just 10 hours available for comparison,\" he said in a statement. \u00a0 (SAFAR) had yesterday said that air quality in Delhi was expected to deteriorate over the next few days with a possible rise in the level of particulate matter due to fall in minimum temperature and calm wind movement. Officials said the air quality remained \"very poor\" today due to atmospheric conditions that did not allow pollutants to get dispersed. While a section of the ruling AAP attributed the sharp drop in PM 2.5 figures between early morning hours and afternoon to the car rationing experiment, scientists said pollutants usually touch their peak in the dawn and then gradually fall. SAFAR stations, located in various areas the city, displayed 'very poor' real-time Air Quality Index, which was in line with the forecast of the Union government body that was released yesterday. In no marked change from yesterday, the average levels of PM 2.5 was around 180 microgrammes per cubic metre, three times above the safe limit of 60. The corresponding safe limit of PM 10 is 100. Central Pollution Control Board's real time AQI for the Punjabi Bagh, R K Puram, NSIT Dwarka and Anand Vihar stations were 'severe' at 5 PM. Air quality is considered 'very poor' by Indian authorities when level of PM 2.5 ranges from 120 to 250 microgrammes per cubic metre. \u00a0                ", "section": "Weather", "topics": {"WEATHER, CALAMITIES": 0.12903225806451613, "METRO AND DEVELOPMENT": 0.5806451612903226, "TRENDING ISSUES": 0.03225806451612903}, "day": 1}

As the number of private cars in the streets of Delhi went down nearly by half, prompting many people to take public transport, this social media provided live information to help people reach their destinations conveniently. Many commuters, not so accustomed to taking public transport and being used to travel in private vehicles, were not at ease with the situation. But, Twitter came in handy for such tech-savvy people, giving them live information, from bus routes to metro links and last-mile connectivity. For getting the desired information, the user had to tweet the origin and destination with a specified format on the Twitter handle of Delhi Transport Department, and in return it provided the route information, including the distance, estimated time of travel and a weather update. So, if the commuter had to travel from Lajpat Nagar to Connaught Place, the format is - @TransportDelhi Origin (Lajpat Nagar) to Destination (Connaught Place) #PollutionFreeDelhi. \"Starting today commuters would get real-time information on shortest routes, options of public transport available between two points, fare details, traffic situation and current weather conditions.\" \"If users want to keep their location and travel details private you can send a direct message to @TransportDelhi and receive the information privately,\" said a statement jointly released by the Delhi government and Twitter today. The Delhi government has entered into an agreement with the micro-blogging site, seeking to help commuters find information about bus routes, metro, autorickshaws during the road-rationing experiment. Twitter users can get details of public transport available in particular areas by tweeting #pollutionfreeDelhi followed by the departure and destination point. Twitter will instantly send users real-time public transport updates pertaining to the area. Social media, including both Facebook and Twitter, was today abuzz with excitement as the road-rationing experiment came into force, with many commuters sharing real-time pictures of relatively less congested streets and probable \"violators\". \"#DelhiOddEven @htTweets @ArvindKejriwal @DelhiTrafficPol even car on odd day.

Sorafenib, a drug that inhibits the growth of new blood vessels, remains the only available therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a common type of liver cancer, researchers said. Thus, a novel approach against HCC is essential for a better therapeutic outcome, they said. Researchers from the United Arab Emirates University examined the chemopreventive action of saffron's main biomolecule, crocin, against chemically-induced liver cancer in rats, and to explore the mechanisms by which crocin employs its anti-tumour effects. \"We investigated the anti-cancer effect of crocin on an experimental carcinogenesis model of liver cancer by studying the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferation, pro-apoptotic activities of crocin in vivo,\" the researchers said. \"In addition, we provided a network analysis of differentially expressed genes in tissues of animals pre-treated with crocin in comparison to induced-HCC animals' tissues,\" they said. To further support the results, in vitro analysis was carried out. The researchers assessed the effects of crocin on HepG2 cells - a perpetual cell line consisting of human liver carcinoma cells - by treating them with various concentrations of crocin. In addition, they studied the effects of crocin on cell cycle distribution of HepG2 cells. The researchers demonstrated the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties of crocin when administrated in induced-HCC model. Crocin exhibited anti-inflammatory properties where a protein complex NF-kB, among other inflammatory markers, was inhibited. In vitro analysis confirmed crocin's effect in HepG2 by arresting the cell division, inducing apoptosis and down regulating inflammation. Network analysis identified NF-kB as a potential regulatory hub, and therefore, a candidate therapeutic drug target. \"Taken together, our findings introduce crocin as a candidate chemopreventive agent against HCC,\" the researchers said.

In his New Year's homily, Francis emphasized the need to \"let ourselves be reborn, to overcome the indifference which blocks solidarity, and to leave behind the false neutrality which prevents sharing.\" After celebrating Mass, the pope came to the window of a Vatican palazzo overlooking St. Peter's Square to offer new year's wishes to a crowd of tens of thousands of tourists and Romans cheering him from below. \"At the start of the year, it's lovely to exchange wishes. Let's renew, to one another, the desire that that which awaits us is a little better\" than what last year brought, Francis said. \"It is, after all, a sign of the hope that animates us and invites us all to believe in life.\" \"We know, however, that with the new year, everything won't change and that many of yesterday's problems will also remain tomorrow,\" the pope said, adding that he was making a \"wish sustained by a real hope.\" As he did in his homily earlier in St Peter's Basilica, the pope issued a caution that \"the enemy of peace isn't only war, but also indifference,\" and he decried \"barriers, suspicions, fears and closures\" toward others. In the New Year's homily in St Peter's, he had reflected on the \"countless forms of injustice and violence which daily wound our human family.\" \"Sometimes we ask ourselves how it is possible that human injustice persists unabated, and that the arrogance of the powerful continues to demean the weak, relegating them to the most squalid outskirts of our world.\" He continued: \"We ask how long human evil will continue to sow violence and hatred in our world, reaping innocent victims.\" Francis cited no country, continent or conflict. But his words clearly evoked images of the refugees and migrants, more than 1 million of whom flooded into Europe from Africa, the Middle East and Asia in 2015, on dangerous sea or overland journeys. He spoke of \"witnessing hordes of men, women and children fleeing war, hunger and persecution, ready to risk their lives simply to encounter respect for their fundamental rights.\" The Catholic church dedicates New Year's Day to the theme of peace, and Francis this year is stressing mercy as the path toward reconciliation. To highlight the benefits springing from forgiveness and reconciliation in the world, Francis declared a Holy Year of Mercy, which began last month and runs through November 2016. Early Friday evening, he was to visit a Rome basilica, St. Mary Major, where he sometimes slips away to pray, to open a normally sealed Holy Door as a symbolic threshold to cross toward mercy for Catholic faithful. \u00a0                ", "section": "Issues", "topics": {"TRENDING ISSUES": 0.28125, "STOCK MARKET": 0.21875, "PUBLIC FIGURES": 0.03125, "CRIME": 0.0625, "INTERNATIONAL ISSUES": 0.0625, "BUSINESS PROFIT AND LOSS": 0.09375}, "day": 1}

Leading exchange BSE has been seeking to get listed for a long time, but its plans have been hanging in balance due to lack of regulatory clearances. Sebi had first announced its norms for listing of bourses over three years ago. The capital markets watchdog has been of the view that necessary safeguards need to be first put in place for tackling conflict of interest and other issues. In a circular, Sebi said the listed stock exchange will have to disseminate the details of its shareholding with category wise breakup on a continuous basis, on its website. Similarly, the bourse where the shares are listed, shall also display this information. Besides, depositories will have to put in place systems for capturing the shareholding data of trading members or their associates and agents and ensure that there is a mechanism for coordination between the depositories towards sharing of information. A mechanism would need to be put in place providing for approval of the listed stock exchange as and when holding of trading members/associates/agents reaches 45 per cent. In case they purchase shares without requisite approval, the depositories will initiate consequential action such as freezing of voting rights and all corporate benefits in respect of such stake till the time the same is divested. The divestment of any excess shareholding beyond the specified limit would be through a special window provided by the stock exchange. The new norms provide that to ensure compliance that every shareholder be Fit and Proper, all applicant in the IPO or Offer For Sale will be required to make declaration to this effect at the time of making application. The listed stock exchange will have to submit an exceptional report regarding the shareholders who are not 'fit and proper' and action taken thereof on a quarterly basis. Sebi will also issue necessary procedures to ensure compliance of the provisions post listing. The shareholding threshold of 2 per cent, 5 per cent or 15 per cent (for different classes of investors) as the case may be, will be monitored through Depository mechanism. \"The depositories shall put in place a mechanism to ensure that no shareholder of listed stock exchange gets credit of shares beyond 5 per cent or 15 per cent, as applicable,\" the regulator said in a circular.

Lynch on Monday to finalize a set of executive actions on guns that he will unveil next week, according to several individuals briefed on the matter. White House officials declined to comment on Obama's plans beyond releasing his weekly radio address on Friday, a day earlier than usual. But according to those familiar with the proposal, who asked for anonymity because it was not yet public, the president will expand new background-check requirements for buyers who purchase weapons from high-volume gun dealers. The president will also use his executive authority in several other areas, these individuals said, but the overall package has not yet been finalized. In the radio address, Obama said he was moving unilaterally because Congress had failed to address the growing problem of gun violence. \"A few months ago, I directed my team at the White House to look into any new actions I can take to help reduce gun violence,\" he said in the recorded address. \"And on Monday, I'll meet with our Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, to discuss our options.\" \"Because I get too many letters from parents, and teachers, and kids, to sit around and do nothing,\" Obama continued. \"I get letters from responsible gun owners who grieve with us every time these tragedies happen; who share my belief that the Second Amendment guarantees a right to bear arms; and who share my belief we can protect that right while keeping an irresponsible, dangerous few from inflicting harm on a massive scale.\" Obama began examining how he could tighten the nation's gun rules after October's mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., but administration lawyers have spent months reviewing any proposals to ensure they can withstand legal scrutiny. The idea of requiring informal gun dealers to obtain a license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and perform background checks on potential buyers first came up two years ago, but was shelved over legal concerns. The current federal statute dictates that those who are \"engaged in the business\" of dealing firearms need to obtain a federal license - and, therefore, conduct background checks - but exempts anyone \"who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms.\" Gun control advocates - including former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., who was gravely injured in a 2011 mass shooting, and former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg - have met personally with Obama over the past month to push for the background checks expansion and other measures. Everytown spokeswoman Erika Soto Lamb, whose group was founded with Bloomberg's support, said the current interpretation of what it means to be \"engaged in the business\" of selling firearms is \"a hazy definition that allows high-volume sellers to transfer thousands of guns without background checks, no questions asked.\" Other proposals the administration has been weighing include requiring federally-licensed gun dealers to report any lost and stolen guns to the National Crime Information Center; publishing aggregate background check denial data for guns sold by unlicensed sellers; clarifying that convicted abusers are prohibited from having guns regardless of their marital status; and instructing federal law enforcement to identify and arrest criminals who attempt to buy illegal guns. Any action by the president is sure to trigger a major backlash from gun rights activists, and Republican lawmakers who have blocked legislative action in the past. On Thursday, the National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action launched the first in a video series attacking gun control advocates. The first ad targets Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, who revived the plan to expand background checks in the wake of the Roseburg shooting by proposing it on the campaign trail. The ad is labeled \"New Year's Resolutions of the Rich and Anti-Gun (Actually, Just Hillary Clinton),\" and it shows a woman outlining her plans on Clinton's campaign stationery beside a photo of the president and his former secretary of state as \"Auld Lang Syne\" blares in the background. \"Stop trying to ban guns,\" she writes as her first point, in black marker, followed by, \"Read the Constitution.\" \"Meet an actual gun owner,\" the Clinton impersonator scribbles, before adding, \"In Person!\" At that point the woman crosses out all three points, crumples up the paper and throws it aside, as Clinton's laugh is heard in the background. Groups such as MoveOn.org, however, have begun to mobilize firearm owners to support expanded background checks and other measures aimed at curbing gun violence. David Mark Williams, a farmer in Halfway, Ore., described guns as \"a tool. If you're hunting or living a rural lifestyle, you're going to have a firearm.\" But Williams, who came to Washington this fall with MoveOn.org to meet with members of both parties, said he resigned his NRA membership after its president opposed stricter gun laws in the aftermath of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. \"I'm also a supporter of rational reasonable gun control measures,\" he said. Advocates from groups such as the Metro Industrial Association said the president could do much more to curb the nearly 90 gun-related deaths that take place each day in the U.S., by not coming to the aid of gun manufacturers who are being sued for negligence; providing additional funding for the development of \"smart gun\" technology; and failing to use the federal government's purchasing power to pressure gun manufacturers to take more responsibility for reducing gun violence. But Arkadi Gerney, a senior fellow at the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, said in an email Thursday it was \"extremely encouraging that the president appears poised\" to enhance the enforcement of existing gun laws given congressional resistance to such measures. \"Along with progress in state legislatures and actions taken by governors and attorneys general, the steps the White House is considering would make it somewhat less likely that guns will end up in the wrong hands,\" Gerney said. \"And, with gunfire claiming the lives of 33,000 American a year, even incremental steps can have life-saving impact.\" \u00a9 2015 The Washington Post                ", "section": "International", "topics": {"INTERNATIONAL ISSUES": 0.39285714285714285, "BUSINESS PROFIT AND LOSS": 0.10714285714285714, "TRENDING ISSUES": 0.2857142857142857, "NATIONAL SECURITY, TERRORISM, SECURITY AGENCY": 0.03571428571428571}, "day": 1}

Indeed, weight loss and exercising continue to be among the most popular New Year's vows, according to a Marist Poll. It would be wonderful if the pounds melted off as soon as we ramped up our workouts and swore off sweets. But many people find that weight loss isn't that simple or that linear. They get stuck in a weight-watching purgatory - dragging themselves through workouts and scrutinizing food labels - while the numbers on the bathroom scale stall or inch upward. \"I hear people say this all the time,\" says Tom McGlynn, founder of Runcoach, which trains 1,500 D.C. area runners annually for the Marine Corps Marathon, Historic Half Marathon and Cherry Blossom 10-Miler. To be sure, some of the initial weight gain is often due to water retention, says Jim White, a Virginia Beach, Va.-based dietitian and exercise physiologist. When you lift weights or run up a hill, the muscle fibers tear. The body responds by producing fluids full of white blood cells and nutrients to heal those fibers so you get stronger, says White. But for more people, the forces that drive the weight gain are much more complex. Here are some common weight-loss traps and how to avoid them. You do too much too soon Many people try to overhaul their diets while simultaneously logging monster workout sessions at a pace that's unsustainable. \"People get all excited about counting calories, they overexercise and undereat, and it ends up being too much restriction,\" says exercise physiologist Jenny Hadfield, founder of coachjenny.com. \"Three weeks after they start, they can't manage it, and the scale tips the other way.\" Without adequate fueling, workouts become a waste of time; with no energy to push their bodies faster, harder and longer, people can't make substantial fitness gains. And the body rebels, Hadfield says. \"When we drastically reduce calorie consumption and combine that with higher levels of exercise, the body adapts by lowering our metabolic rates.\" So you may drop pounds at first, but eventually you regain the weight, and then some. And there's new evidence that excess restriction messes with the body's hunger mechanism. In a study published in the December 2015 issue of eLife, when rats' meal times were limited, levels of the fullness hormone ghrelin plummeted and they ate twice as much. Hadfield says baby steps are often more effective. With exercise, do a variety of workouts: short easy aerobic efforts, endurance-building long sessions, strength and cross-training. And make one to two small dietary changes at a time. Give yourself time to adjust to each change before making another. \"Even just a glass of wine can be the difference between maintaining and losing weight,\" says White. But don't get rid of the pre-workout nosh. White recommends eating a snack of 100 calories 30 minutes before exercise - say a piece of fruit, a cup of yogurt or half a granola bar. \"You just don't want to be hungry, as that can cause you to be weak,\" he says. Experiment with different foods to figure out what gives you a boost without upsetting your stomach. You adopt a diet off the shelf Many people hitch their weight-loss hopes to a popular diet, declaring themselves low-carb, Paleo, or gluten-free without considering their own likes and lifestyles. If a diet requires consuming specialty foods that drain your wallet or make you feel chronically deprived, it isn't likely to last. \"One-size-fits-all programs can be effective in the short term,\" says White, \"but they can be too hard to follow and people often end up gaining weight back.\" Adopt an eating plan that you can afford and enjoy. And allow yourself a weekly treat meal. Just don't regard it as a \"cheat\" meal, White warns, which perpetuates a fear-based attitude about food. Indeed, research suggests that the idea of cheating can derail your diet. In a study published in the March 2014 issue of Appetite, people who associated chocolate cake with guilt reported less control over eating and were less successful at weight loss compared to those who associated the cake with celebration. Your eating and exercise habits don't work Any diet must support your exercise routine so you get adequate amounts of nutrients. Coaches say they see a lot of people attempting low-carb diets while training for endurance events like marathons, which often backfires. Carbs are the nutrient the body can most efficiently convert into energy. So trying to exercise without carbs \"is like trying to drive your car with zero gas,\" says White. \"People go to exercise, they have no energy, they hate it and get discouraged.\" Once you pick a workout routine or a sports goal, meet with a dietitian to customize an eating plan that will complement it. You go overboard with the energy bars Grocery shelves are packed with sports bars that promise to deliver speed, strength and energy. Snack, nutrition and protein bars have become a $6.2 billion market, according to Mintel, the Chicago research firm. And sales of performance bars geared to enhancing fitness and exercise have skyrocketed by 83 percent since 2009. Many of these products have calorie, sugar and fat profiles that rival conventional candy bars. Though these foods are designed for refueling during workouts of 60 minutes or longer, many people go overboard once they start working out. \"People eat those products and figure 'that wasn't real food, now I have to go get a real meal,' \" says McGlynn. \"Meanwhile they just ate 500 calories.\" He encourages clients to focus on fruits, vegetables and grains for carbs; poultry, fish and lean red meat for protein; and nuts and avocados for fats. \"Spend the calories on natural foods that we know have vitamins and nutrients that are beneficial,\" he says. You overcompensate for calorie burn Many people find that the more they exercise, the more they eat, either because the increased activity makes them hungrier or because they feel entitled to a donut after a tough workout. In a study published in the May 2014 issue of Marketing Letters, people who were told a two-kilometer walk was exercise ate 35 percent more chocolate pudding afterward than those who thought the same stroll was a \"scenic walk.\" And it takes only minutes to eat back the calories burned on a 30-minute run. To avoid this, before your workout, prepare a post-workout snack that you can grab when you return - say some fat-free Greek yogurt and a piece of fruit, or some rice cakes with peanut butter. And find ways to make your calorie burn fun. Meet a friend for a run so your workout becomes a social hour. Download audiobooks and reserve your exercise time for entertainment. Most important, find a form of exercise that you genuinely enjoy. If you dread it, you're not going to do it. \u00a9 2015 The Washington Post                ", "section": "Health", "topics": {"STATE GOVERNMENT, GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS": 0.03333333333333333, "INTERNATIONAL ENTERTAINMENT, INTERNATIONAL CELEBRITIES": 0.03333333333333333, "HEALTH AND LIVING": 0.26666666666666666, "BUSINESS AND COMPANIES": 0.03333333333333333, "NATIONAL SECURITY, TERRORISM, SECURITY AGENCY": 0.03333333333333333}, "day": 1}

Talking about the new base rate calculation based on the marginal cost of funds, Bhattacharya said the formula will not make a huge amount of difference on base rate but will help in transmission. \"Some more amount of transmission will definitely happen but I don't think it is going to be humongous.\" However, many analysts have pegged an 80-160 bps reduction in base rate by banks from April when the new method will be in force. On the Rs 12,000-crore follow-on public offer that the lender was planning to raise, she said SBI is unlikely to raise the money in this fiscal. The bank had been planning this OFS sale even in last fiscal as market was not conducive. \"I don't think we have any clear plans now. I don't think it will happen this fiscal year but then let's see.\" After a meeting of its Committee of Directors on December 21, 2015, the bank had said in a regulatory filing that it had got permission to raise up to Rs 12,000 crore by selling Basel-III compliant Tier-II bonds on a private\u00a0placement basis. Following this, SBI had on December 24 raised Rs 4,000 crore through Tier-II bonds on private placement basis under Basel-III norms. On the RBI deadline of March 2017 to clean up the balance-sheets, Bhattacharya said banks were in dialogue with the RBI. \"The RBI is having dialogues with banks. They are saying that where there are accounts which are inherently weak, it is better that we recognise them and we provide against them,\" Bhattacharya said. Asked about the media reports of her name doing the rounds for the next Sebi chief, the veteran banker said there was no truth in them. \"This is said by the media. I don't know. You have to tell me where you get the information from,\" she quipped.

The findings demonstrated dietary sugar's effect on an enzymatic signalling pathway known as 12-LOX (12-lipoxygenase), researchers said. \"We found that sucrose intake in mice comparable to levels of Western diets led to increased tumour growth and metastasis, when compared to a non-sugar starch diet,\" said Peiying Yang, assistant professor at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Centre in US. \"This was due, in part, to increased expression of 12-LOX and a related fatty acid called 12-HETE,\" said Yang. Previous epidemiological studies have shown that dietary sugar intake has an impact on breast cancer development, with inflammation thought to play a role. \"The current study investigated the impact of dietary sugar on mammary gland tumour development in multiple mouse models, along with mechanisms that may be involved,\" said Lorenzo Cohen, professor of Palliative, Rehabilitation and Integrative Medicine. \"We determined that it was specifically fructose, in table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup, ubiquitous within our food system, which was responsible for facilitating lung metastasis and 12-HETE production in breast tumours,\" said Cohen. Cohen added that the data suggested that dietary sugar induces 12-LOX signalling to increase risks for breast cancer development and metastasis. Identifying risk factors for breast cancer is a public health priority, researchers said. \"Prior research has examined the role of sugar, especially glucose, and energy-based metabolic pathways in cancer development,\" said Yang. \"However, the inflammatory cascade may be an alternative route of studying sugar-driven carcinogenesis that warrants further study,\" Yang said. The team conducted four different studies in which mice were randomised to different diet groups and fed one of four diets. At six months of age, 30 per cent of mice on a starch-control diet had measurable tumours, whereas 50 to 58 per cent of the mice on sucrose-enriched diets had developed mammary tumours. The study also showed that numbers of lung metastases were significantly higher in mice on a sucrose- or a fructose-enriched diet, versus mice on a starch-control diet. \"This study suggests that dietary sucrose or fructose induced 12-LOX and 12-HETE production in breast tumour cells in vivo,\" said Cohen. \"This indicates a possible signalling pathway responsible for sugar-promoted tumour growth in mice. How dietary sucrose and fructose induces 12-HETE and whether it has a direct or indirect effect remains in question,\" Cohen added. The study was published in the journal Cancer Research. \u00a0                ", "section": "Health", "topics": {"HEALTH AND LIVING": 0.9459459459459459}, "day": 1}

While complimenting the people of Delhi for \"success\" of odd-even formula, the ministers also said that future implementation of the scheme will depend on the people and how they respond to it. Delhi Tourism minister Kapil Mishra was the first to rode to the Secretariat on his motorbike a few minutes before 9 am. \"It took me just 20 minutes to cover the distance from my Yamuna Vihar residence to Secretariat which normally would take 1.5 hours on any day,\" said the young minister. \"There is different scene on the roads and traffic is less. I did not see any violator on the road. Since people of Delhi are sacrificing, we will also be sacrificing,\" said Mr Mishra who owes an odd numbered car. \"I could have driven in my odd numbered car today but I have decided to commute to Secretariat for next 14 days on my motorbike,\" he said adding that he was riding bike after a gap of 5-6 months. Next to arrive was Deputy CM Manish Sisodia who came in his official odd numbered car. Mr Sisodia said the people of Delhi were participating in a \"virtuous\" initiative to reduce pollution adding that he also did not find any even numbered car on the road. \"People of Delhi have adopted it (odd-even) as their own mission and the government is just helping them. This is the ideal situation in this campaign,\" he said. Mr Sisodia hoped that with the 15 days trail people will get used to odd-even formula which will help in lowering high pollution level in the city. The odd-even formula implemented in Delhi is being watched all over the world, if successful it could be implemented in other cities also, Mr Sisodia said adding that after 15 days further steps against pollution will evolve out of the experiment. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal who will be car-polling during 15 days of odd-even experiment, arrived at Secretariat at around 10.45 am. He was accompanied by his cabinet colleagues PWD and Health minister Satyender Jain and Transport minister Gopal Rai. Social Welfare minister of Delhi government Sandeep Kumar took a bus to reach Secretariat while his colleague and Environment and Forest minister Imran Hussain arrived in an e-rickshaw. Delhi Social Welfare minister Sandeep Kumar termed his bus ride as a \"stress buster\" as he could interact freely with fellow passengers. The minister who owns an odd number car said that he often comes to Secretariat in bus so it was in his \"habit\". He also said that he will commute by bus for the rest of odd-even trial days.

I will come to Secretariat by it for the remaining days,\" he said. The minister also urged the Central government and governments in states neighbouring Delhi to take steps to help reducing pollution in the national capital. \"I appeal to the Centre and the neighbouring states to check the pollution caused by nearly 4000 brick kilns, construction sites not following NGT orders and crop burning in the vicinity of Delhi,\" he said. \u00a0                ", "section": "Government", "topics": {"MINISTRY AND DEPARTMENTS, MINISTERS": 0.13513513513513514, "TRANSPORTATION, ROAD SAFETY": 0.08108108108108109, "METRO AND DEVELOPMENT": 0.7027027027027027, "ENTERTAINMENT": 0.02702702702702703}, "day": 1}

I know I could. The Washington Post's budget, however, doesn't stretch to provide each reporter with a personal aide. But thanks to the magic of technology, I have regular access to five digital assistants: Siri, Cortana, Alexa, Google Now and an email-based scheduling assistant called Amy. It should be a breeze for anyone trying to get themselves organized as part of a New Year's resolution. It should be fantastic. But, if I'm perfectly frank, I'm really no closer to getting anything done. The idea of an assistant is appealing but hard to implement, said Dennis Mortensen, chief executive of x.ai, a company that makes an artificial intelligence assistant that you can copy on your emails to set up appointments. The most popular assistants out there, Mortensen said, are really \"enablers\" rather than programs that help you. They give you information so you can do things, but don't actually do much for you. Not only did I find that out, but I also noticed in the process that you're giving up a lot of information. These things need to know your schedules, your habits, your favorite contacts and more to work well. That's about as much, in fact, as you'd have to give to an actual personal assistant - something that may make many uncomfortable. Digital assistants are relatively new technology, and not all digital assistants have been created equal. There's Siri, for instance. Apple's digital assistant is generally good at understanding what you're saying, operating your iPhone and taking care of some basic communication functions. Need to send a text? Siri's your gal. (Or guy, as Siri is on my phone.) Ditto for short emails, finding quick sports scores and setting short appointments. Microsoft's Cortana, which is built into Windows 10, is similar to Siri. You can ask her for answers to basic questions, get traffic updates and manage your calendar. Both are also skilled, if that's the word, at telling corny jokes. Their greatest utility lies in basic communication and information gathering. Google Now also provides a similar service, though without the constructed personality. Google Now also has the advantage of being plugged into, well, the powerhouse of knowledge that is Google. It gets better if you plug in your own email account, but even without that level of information sharing, Google Now can pull up really good search results, and can identify songs, which I think is a neat trick. Slightly off that path is Alexa, Amazon's assistant, which is housed in its Echo speaker. She's more like a personal assistant for your home rather than for the rest of your life, able to set timers and provide you with news updates. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos is also the owner of The Washington Post.) She won't, however, be able to provide you with coffee shops or do much in the way of meaningful search. In fact, she's not mobile at all. That limits the use cases. I find I use Alexa most when I'm cooking or sitting at the kitchen counter paying bills. Those are the times when I'll want the news and sports updates she can offer. So basically, Alexa is good for passive help rather than active help. (Alexa, by the way, will also tell you punny jokes.) I have to say that, in testing, Alexa's always-on listening has led to the most interesting outcomes. She sometimes hears her name when it hasn't been said, which can be unnerving. Alexa and Siri can also be set up to work with smart home appliances, which paves the way for both systems to be more like the Star Trek computer we've been dreaming about for decades. But not quite yet. All of this is nice enough. But it's very rare that any of this saves me any time. When I send messages, for example, I'm constantly having to correct some part of it. In about 90 percent of cases, I was better off typing my own messages or searches. Assistants are designed to get better over time, but that means that you keep training them after you set them up, which is asking a lot of users. Part of this is my fault. I have tech commitment issues. I use a Mac and a PC, have both an iPhone and Galaxy S6, and split my email between Microsoft for work and Google for personal matters. But even if I could commit to a tech universe, I'd still have to hop back and forth between assistants to get everything that I wanted. Alexa will only tell me what's on my Google calendar, for example. So if I use Siri to set up an appointment on Apple's Calendar, it won't flow over automatically. I've done a lot to hook up various accounts so that I get actual meaning out of my interactions with these assistants. But I'm hardly a normal person when it comes to enthusiasm and patience with technology. Which is what makes the assistant from x.ai so interesting. All it does is schedule things: you copy it on emails where you're trying to set up meetings, and it sends reasonably cheerful emails to your other participants to find a mutually agreeable time. Mortensen sees his own company's assistant, Amy Ingram (AI, get it?), as a vertical agent: she takes care of one task well, rather than trying to be an all-in-one. She had her set-up woes as well. Amy also works just with Google calendars for now, though broader support is planned by the time the product launches this year. Once I got Amy up and running, I did have a glimpse of a more efficient future: the first time I felt like I was actually delegating to another person. I sent an initial email, Amy did all the follow-up, and all I had to do was show up for a call. Interacting with her may have been strange for others - Mortensen even uses Amy to schedule things with his wife, though admits that may not work for everyone - but it saved me a lot of the \"just checking in\" emails that I'm accustomed to typing while grinding my teeth. Mortensen thinks that, eventually, agents and assistants will end up like apps: You'll pick the ones you want from a marketplace with lots of specialized assistants. So if you need help with analyzing data, you'll find an agent that can help you look for trends. If you want to make restaurant reservations, you can give your \"assistant\" some times and places and trust that things will be set up for you. After managing all of my assistants for a few months, I'm inclined to agree that the most promising ones are those that can actually do something for you. At the very least, I'd like to at least be able to say these assistants save you enough time to pay you back for what you do setting them up. I can't say that yet, for any of the assistants I tested. So until those are more widespread, I'm going to stick to my trusty paper planner and my own 10 fingers - or two thumbs, as the case may be. \u00a9 2015 The Washington Post                ", "section": "Crime, Law and Order", "topics": {"INTERNATIONAL SPORTS": 0.125, "POLICE": 0.4375, "TRENDING ISSUES": 0.0625, "BUSINESS AND COMPANIES": 0.3125}, "day": 1}

The three were beaten up and later dumped on the road. Salwinder Singh, a SP-rank officer from Gurdaspur, said the men intercepted his vehicle near Dinanagar when he was returning from Pathankot late night on Thursday and assaulted him. The men then forced themselves into the car and later pushed the passengers out of the moving vehicle. The police are looking for the alleged attackers who could not be identified. No arrests have been made in the case so far. In another incident near Pathankot today, the police have found body of a man apparently killed in a car robbery. The man identified as Narot Jaimal Singh was a resident of Kathlore village in Gurdaspur. His Innova car was later recovered two kilometres from where the body was found. It could not be immediately ascertained if the two incidents were related. The police were put on alert and security forces were combing the areas especially near the border with Pakistan. In July last year, Gurdaspur became the target of the worst terrorist attack in the state in a decade after three terrorists in army fatigues, equipped with Chinese-made grenades and AK 47s, opened fire in Dinanagar killing three civilians. The terrorists were shot dead after a 12-hour long gun battle with the security forces in which four policemen were also killed.

The toll booth is located on the Rothak-Delhi road in Jhajjar district. Police said Sampla municipal committee chairman Sudhir Kumar, who is also reportedly a local leader of the BJP, had refused to pay the toll tax for his car and misbehaved with the toll booth employee Feroze Khan last night. Later, he called in his friends and they beat up Mr Khan. The footage shows two men standing at the door of the booth, repeatedly slapping and punching Mr Kumar, who fell and then tried to barricade himself with a chair. The men then beat him up with a steel rod and eventually dragged him out. Mr Kumar's assailants also misbehaved with the security guards and vandalized the toll booth, the police said.

The letter was released to the press today. Reminding Prime Minister Modi of the need to implement the Lokpal and Lokayukta properly and fulfil other key poll promises, Mr Hazare said that several letters written by him earlier on these subjects to the Prime Minister had been ignored. \"I am writing again to remind you of these things. I am aware that several letters written by me to you have been dumped in the waste paper basket. This letter may also meet the same fate,\" Mr Hazare has accused. \"I don't expect a PM to respond to each and every letter written to him as it is not possible. However, there should be reply to the letter by a social activist who has dedicated his life to the nation,\" Mr Hazare wrote. In his latest letter, Mr Hazare said the Modi government should implement the Lokpal and Lokayukta laws properly to curb corruption and also take steps to ensure that farmers got remunerative prices for their produce. \"Corruption rose during the Congress-led regime earlier. Nobody could get work done in any office earlier without paying bribe. \"People trusted your words but even today no work gets done without paying money. Inflation has also not come down,\" \"Promise of bringing back black money has also not been kept. You don't speak of implementation of the Lokpal and Lokayukta laws passed for curbing corruption. May be you have forgotten the things which you promised,\" Mr Hazare wrote. Anna Hazare also recalled that when he undertook the fast at Ramlila ground in Delhi it was not only the then Congress government but also BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley had given an assurance in Parliament that the anti-corruption legislation will be passed. \"When Narasimha Rao was the PM, he used to speak on phone sometimes. When (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee came to Pune he used to enquire (about me). Manmohan Singh against whom I wrote, used to reply to my letters. Senior RSS leader Seshadri visited my village Ralegan Siddhi and wrote a book 'Karmayogi Ka Gaon,\" Mr Hazare said giving vent to his anguish on being allegedly ignored by PM Modi. \u00a0                ", "section": "Issues", "topics": {"MINISTRY AND DEPARTMENTS, MINISTERS": 0.28205128205128205, "ECONOMIC GROWTH": 0.23076923076923078, "POLITICAL PARTY, POLITICAL LEADER": 0.10256410256410256, "TRENDING ISSUES": 0.358974358974359}, "day": 1}
