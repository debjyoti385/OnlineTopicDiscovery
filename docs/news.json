The technique - which leverages polymer chemistry and UV light in some novel ways - could find use in high-temperature settings at scales ranging from microelectromechanical devices to jet engines, researchers said.  Three-dimensional printing of ceramics holds some big potential advantages, owing to its ability to create complex shapes that are difficult to create using conventional methods.  The most common additive-manufacturing techniques for ceramics, involving layer-by-layer, selective curing of powder-based precursors, have been painfully slow, and have created products with unacceptably high porosity and a tendency towards strength-reducing cracks.  Looking for a better, faster approach, researchers at the HRL Laboratories in California built on previous developments in two areas: ceramic polymer chemistry and the details of UV light control in the additive-manufacturing process.  The researchers tweaked the chemistry of inorganic preceramic monomers, which have been used for decades to synthesise ceramic fibres and similar materials, to make the monomers build into polymer chains when exposed to UV light.  Next, they experimented with several approaches to spatial control of additive manufacturing using a resin of these UV-curable preceramic monomers.  In one particularly interesting technique, the monomer additives were selected so that they not only facilitate polymerisation, but create a change in the index of refraction of the resin as it polymerises - such that the UV light is internally reflected and concentrated within the ceramic polymer as it is built.  In essence, the growing ceramic chain becomes a waveguide that facilitates and controls further polymerisation by collimated UV light at the tip.  A final pyrolysis step at the end, which involves heating the printed polymer to 1,000 degrees Celsius in inert argon gas, drives off any remaining volatiles, leaving behind a pure ceramic part.  The result of the process is flexible, strong 3D printed components consisting of cross-linked ceramic networks.  Electron microscopy confirmed that the ceramic material contains little or no porosity and cracking.  Other tests suggest that the material can withstand temperatures of some 1,400 degrees Celsius without degradation and shows mechanical strength \\","size":1},{"name":"            Airline stocks surged on Friday in an otherwise flat market on a steep cut in aviation fuel prices. \\u00a0Indian Oil Corporation has slashed aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices by 10 per cent, following a sharp fall in global oil prices.\\u00a0 After the steep cut, ATF prices in Delhi currently stand at Rs 39,892 per kiloliter, down from nearly 10 per cent from Rs 44,320 in December.\\u00a0 Fuel contributes around 40-50 per cent of the operating cost of airline companies in India.

Windowless and minimally decorated, this room in the business centre looks like it could double as the set for an interrogation room used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the TV series Homeland. Mishra, who has just flown in from Mumbai and has a speech to give at the hotel on the power generation industry immediately after our lunch, is huddled over his smartphone. He looks utterly preoccupied. None of this seems like a good omen for a discursive, leisurely lunch.First impressions prove to be misleading, however. Mishra\\u2019s answer to my first question about the move towards a low-carbon world being more talked about than realised is akin to flicking a switch that bathes the gloomy room in bright light. On the one hand, there is pressure for the lowest tariffs among governments, Mishra says. On the other, a big push for renewables. We are speaking a couple of weeks before the climate change conference in Paris. \\u201cGovernments around the world are not quite making up their minds on how to (manage) the transition to a decarbonising world,\\u201d says Mishra. Policy is caught in what he describes as \\u201cthe energy trilemma\\u201d: ensuring low costs for the consumer, a focus on reducing emissions and ensuring competition. He points to the Chinese turbine manufacturer CLP buys its power turbines from for its coal-fired plant in Jhajjar, Haryana, which actually saw sales fall in 2014 as China rapidly moves towards using cleaner sources of energy. Alongside this enormous change, people are also looking at what might disrupt the business. \\u201cInternationally, people are asking, \\u2018Who is going to be the Uber of power and change the model?\\u2019\\u201dBeing a company with its headquarters in Hong Kong, CLP saw early that the pollution caused by China\\u2019s rush for industrial growth would lead inevitably to demands for cleaner electricity. In 2007, CLP \\u2014 which is one-third owned by the Kadoorie family and has no mainland Chinese ownership \\u2014 laid out carbon dioxide emission reduction targets for 2050, revising them in 2010 to reduce carbon intensity to 0.2 kg CO2 for every kilowatt hour by 2050, a steep drop from 0.84 kg CO2 per kilowatt hour in 2007.In 2015, India itself became a fervent convert to the cause of wind and solar power, setting incredible targets that, if achieved, would be the subject of modern-day mythology. The target for solar power, for instance, is to jump from an installed capacity of 4,000 Mw in 2015 to 100,000 Mw by 2022. Neither China nor Germany, world leaders in this arena and industrial behemoths, have come close to such an increase.The company is still figuring out whether money can be made as bids ratchet downwards to seemingly uneconomic levels. SunEdison\\u2019s bid of a historically low tariff of Rs 4.63 per unit of power to secure a 500Mw solar power park in Andhra Pradesh has rattled many in the industry. \\u201cWe obviously have to do it at a level that makes sense to our shareholders,\\u201d Mishra says. Then, in a classic Mishra riff, this unusually forthright managing director has much more to say on this. Some months ago, Mishra told The Financial Express that the absurdly low coal block auction bids by power and infrastructure companies were akin to \\u201ccompanies trying to commit suicide\\u2026 if you keep trying, you will succeed eventually.\\u201d Why pricing is so low is the \\u201ctrillion dollar question\\u201d, he tells me. \\u201cCompetitive (bidding) in India often results in irrational exuberance.\\u201d Then, he points to the fact that power producers for solar power in China are being paid a good bit more. Given that China is the world\\u2019s most competitive exporter of solar panels \\u2014 one can even buy them off Alibaba.com \\u2014 it seems implausible that producers in India could guarantee a lower tariff.\\u201cExactly where is this competitive advantage coming from,\\u201d he asks rhetorically. \\u201cOur ease, or rather unease, of doing business is higher. Our construction periods are longer. How come tariffs are less?\\u201d Mishra says that it will be a year or so before we find out if these bids are commercially viable because banks will either finance them or balk at doing so. \\u201cOne must have the humility to figure this out. It would be stupid to say, \\u2018We are the only wise guys in the room\\u2019.\\u201d A few years ago, CLP chose not to bid for the tautologically named ultra mega power projects in India, deciding wisely that they were too risky. Of the 16 4,000 Mw plants planned, only four were awarded and just two are operational.Mishra is philosophically solidly behind the push to renewables and lowering emission levels from coal and gas plants. But, he worries that in India, the \\u201cconcern for lower tariffs crowds out everything else\\u201d. I say that when I lived in Beijing, pollution levels were always being discussed on social media, but until very recently, this seemed much less of an issue among the population in India than it was in autocratic China. \\u201cYou have just defined why I don\\u2019t make five-year forecasts in India,\\u201d he jokes in response before turning serious. \\u201cI am also an Indian and a father and I often wonder why\\u2026 The popular narrative is \\u2018how much are the power generators fleecing consumers\\u2019.\\u201d In Jhajjar, he says, 75 per cent of the tariff paid to CLP India is in effect a payment to Coal India and the Indian Railways.I had heard from a friend in Hong Kong that Mishra often arrives in the city with detailed shopping lists for his children. I ask him about this and he immediately shows me a photograph of his son and daughter who are 17 and 13. Half of his daughter\\u2019s requests are various kinds of health foods because she is a vegan. One request was for \\u201cnutritional yeast which is stuck in customs in Mumbai\\u201d even after he had responded to a five-page questionnaire.At this point, I am not only hungry, but concerned that the food order has been similarly lost in transit between the business centre and the hotel\\u2019s restaurants. But, minutes after I ask about this apologetically, pizzas and buffalo mozzarella with tomato arrives. There is also rigatoni with meat and a zingy arrabiata. We discuss Mishra\\u2019s passion for running marathons. In 2014, he did a full marathon in Slovenia. \\u201cOver the years, we have come to love old Europe, especially Eastern Europe because it is unexplored. We always drive.\\u201dBack in Mumbai, the family has particular views on how to spend weekends in and out of the city. Mishra does not check emails on the weekend. Moreover, \\u201cwhen all four of us go out, no one is allowed to carry a phone. Time-out means time-out\\u201d. This seems a model approach to a work-life balance.The conversation returns to the brave new world for renewables. In India, the push to produce clean energy may collide head-on with the need for state electricity boards to become financially viable and a resulting reluctance on their part to buy electricity because they lose money selling it at subsidised rates. If you are losing 60 to 70 paise for every unit of power, \\u201cthe rational response is not to sell\\u201d, he says. CLP has a large wind plant in Tamil Nadu, where wind power benefits from two monsoons, but often just when the company\\u2019s wind unit is producing the most, it is unable to sell on to the grid. Other states claim \\u201cgrid emergencies\\u201d and decline to buy, he reports. Some states have renewable purchase obligations, but \\u201cnot a single state has been penalised\\u201d. \\u201cDo you have the right signals in the regulatory structure,\\u201d Mishra asks. That has been the perennial question in the electricity sector for two decades now. Waiting for the answer may make the youthful Mishra (and others in the power sector) turn grey. Time\\u2019s up and before I am out the door, Mishra is working on his emails again. CLP\\u2019s marathon man appears to have the stamina to navigate this arduous journey.

The Japanese airline plans to introduce the double-decker planes on flights to Hawaii and other overseas destinations, in an effort to boost its international business.  The company paid about 150 billion Yen (USD 1.23 billion) for the three A380 planes, which have 500 seats, more than double the number of spots on ANA planes that currently fly to Hawaii, the business daily said.  In 2014, ANA was ahead of its rival Japan Airlines (JAL) in terms of passenger count on international flights, but JAL served more people on the Tokyo to Hawaii route -- 35 per cent of all Hawaii-bound passengers compared to ANA's 20 per cent.  ANA hopes the superjumbo jet purchase will give it a leg up and allow it to increase the number of people it serves on flights to Hawaii.  About 1.5 million people travel from Japan to Hawaii ever year, according to the Hawaiian Tourism Authority.  ANA's domestic rival Skymark Airlines signed a contract with Airbus in 2011 to buy six A380 jets, but the superjumbo manufacturer cancelled the 2.2 billion order in July 2014, apparently over concerns it would not get paid.

Jessica Steindorff, who claimed she suffered loss of wages and earning capacity, settled her personal claim with Jenner, reported Entertainment Tonight.  Steindorff had also sought compensation for hospital and other medical expenses.  Jenners insurance company will be making the settlement payment to Steindorff.  On February 7, 2015, Jenner was involved in a multi-vehicle crash that resulted in the death of 69-year-old actress Kim Howe and alleged injuries to seven other people.

India will meet defending champions Afghanistan in what will be a replay of 2013 edition in Kathmandu. In the second semi-final, Afghanistan hammered Sri Lanka 5-0 to make it a repeat of the 2013 edition in Kathmandu.  Mohammad Hashemi (45'+), Kanischka Taher (50th min), Khaibar Amani (56th min), Ahmad Arash Hatifi (78th min), Faysal Shayesteh (89th min) were the scorers for the defending champions.  In the India match, once again showing his scoring abilities after an impressive Indian Super League (ISL), Jeje found the net in the 34th and 66th minute after skipper Sunil Chhetri put the hosts ahead with a nod in the 25th minute at the Trivandrum International Stadium.  Ahmed Nashi (45'+2') and Amdaan Ali (75) were on target for Maldives in a match that was marked by wonderful attacking play and poor defending.  Seeking a record 7th SAFF title, India were on the game from the word go as Chhetri played one to Arnab Mondal whose left-footed shot deflected off Jeje's feet on its way into the back of the net. However, the 24-year-old Chennaiyin FC striker was ruled off-side.  In the 22nd minute, Holicharan Narzary's flick off a Eugeneson Lyngdoh corner was cleared just in time by the Maldives' defence.  India soon broke the deadlock when the country's all-time leading scorer Chhetri cashed in on a Narzary cross from the right and headed in the ball past the Maldives goalkeeper mran. Before that Lyngdoh's shot was kept out by the custodian.  There was another chance for India, but Imran kept out Jeje's attempt before finally giving in when Narzary played one over the Maldives defence to Jeje, who slotted it in past the hapless goalkeeper to make it 2-0 for the home side coached by Stephen Constantine.  160th ranked Maldives looked desperate for a goal and Ahmed Nashid delivered the goods for the visiting side when he made use of a pass from Imaaz, who received the ball from Ali Ashfaq.  Almost certain to improve on their current FIFA ranking of 166 after this win, India were celebrating again as Jeje made it 3-1. Chhetri played one for Jeje inside the box and the Mizo lad dribbled past Amdaan Ali and then Shafiu Ahmed before placing the ball to the goalkeeper's right.  With a cushion of two goals, Constantine decided to call back Chhetri and brought in the highly promising Chhangte Lallianzuala in the 74th minute. A minute later, Maldives gave themselves hope with a strike through Ali Amdaan, who headed in a corner after outjumping Arnab Mondal.  Even as Maldives desperately tried to look for an equaliser, India, who attacked with flair, held onto the lead to emerge triumphant after two brilliant assists from Narzary.

The year 2015 also brought cheer to cricket lovers as the Raipur-based international stadium hosted two matches of Indian Premier League in May.  In May, the visit of Prime Minister  Narendra Modi  to the strife-torn Dantewada district became the talking point when around 500 villagers were held hostage by the rebels on the day of his tour to Tongpal area of neighbouring Sukma opposing the construction of a bridge on a river in the area.  Later, a local villager who was supervising construction work on the river was killed even as the others were released by the rebels.

While the Modi government\\u2019s diplomatic moves appear to have soothed the turbulence in relations on India\\u2019s west, its ties with close northern neighbour Nepal need urgent mending.  With the Madhesi agitation on the border, which Nepal maintains is backed by India, still continuing, the shortage in supply of essentials is likely to add a bitter tinge to the creeping winter in the friendly relations.  Nepal is one of India\\u2019s closest neighbours, sharing ties of culture and tradition, and marriage links across the border. It is the only country with which India has visa-free and passport-free travel. Thousands of Nepalese live and work in India and many Indians have settled down in Nepal, set up businesses there. The \\u201cRoti Beti\\u201d links are an accepted facet of the relations.  Highlighting the new strain in ties, Nepalese Prime Minister KP Oli has chosen to visit China on his first overseas trip after taking over, in a break from tradition. Most Nepalese prime ministers visit India on their first state visit. The other exception was Pushpa Kamal Dahal \\u2018Prachanda\\u2019, Nepal\\u2019s 33rd prime minister and chairman of the Maoist party, who visited Beijing instead of New Delhi in 2008.  Modi conveyed to Oli, during a telephonic call by the latter on Thursday, the \\u201cimportance of finding a durable solution to the political problems facing Nepal based on consensus or \\u2018sahmati\\u2019.  Oli\\u2019s decision to visit China looks aimed at rankling India. The Nepalese prime minister has not shied from making anti-India statements. Beijing, while it will obviously welcome the decision of the Nepalese prime minister to visit China, would not be willing to upset India.  India-China relations are going smoothly, despite the border hiccups. Besides, Beijing would be keen to prevent the Tibetan uprising from billowing, and for that keeping its southern border with Nepal impervious is necessary. Closer ties with Nepal would mean opening up the border outposts that got buried after the Nepal earthquake. Beijing is not keen to reopen the posts yet.  India\\u2019s new policy on Nepal -- of not bending backwards to please \\u2013 apparently has the blessings of the Prime Minister\\u2019s Office.\\u00a0  The talk in the diplomatic corridors is that India has always gone overboard to help Nepal in every way, and been taken for granted. \\u00a0India is keen that Nepal heeds the Madhesi demands, of greater representation and inclusiveness. Otherwise the discontent in the Terai could spillover in the form of violence into India\\u2019s northern border.  Perhaps the Modi government could use the expertise and goodwill of those political leaders who have used their good offices in the past with Nepal to bring about rapprochement.  Just like the new Pakistan policy, where the Lahore visit has helped sow the promise of warmth and dialogue, maybe the Modi government could do something similar out-of-the-box.","size":1},{"name":"The year 2015 started with the possibility of Grexit, when the ultra-left Alexis Tsipras became the Prime Minister of Greece. The year ended with the possibility of Brexit, when the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, finally submitted his wish-list for renegotiating the British-EU relationship. This was the sequel to a dramatic speech that David Cameron gave in 2013 when he promised that if the Conservative Party retained power in the next general election, he would try to extract far-reaching concessions from the EU, and based on the outcome would ask the British people in a referendum to decide on the continued membership in the EU before the end of 2017. Now that he retained power in the general election this year, he had to act.  Cameron basically had four demands: 1) EU should be more competitive and pursue more trade deals; 2) a bigger role for national parliaments and a recognition that Britain was not bound by ever closer union; 3) a guarantee that euro-zone members would not discriminate against non-members; and 4) denying EU citizens migrating to Britain social benefits until after four years of their residency there. He was quite flexible at first and asked only for the changes to be \\u201clegally binding\\u201d and \\u201cirreversible\\u201d, without insisting on a new treaty. He was very courteous, met all the 27 other EU heads of government and key officials in Brussels. He realised that all EU partners were against Brexit and was emboldened enough to ask for parliaments of all EU members to ratify the treaty. The polite diplomacy undertaken so far became quite hostile and the deal that Cameron wanted to seal in the December 17-18 end-of-the-year summit of the EU heads of government suddenly got tangled in controversy and recrimination.  Cameron is in a hurry. Already the initial wide lead of the \\u2018yes\\u2019 camp is getting narrower, with one poll just before the summit predicting a neck-and-neck race. If this trend continues, the outcome of the referendum in favour of a Brexit cannot be ruled out. Any decent outcome of the negotiations would help Cameron to announce the referendum by the end of summer. Even more interesting is the attitude of the English people about the EU. Scotland is expected to vote overwhelmingly in favour of remaining within the EU. In fact, continued membership in the EU is their main strength if they decide to secede from the United Kingdom in future. This means that only a minority of English voters already want to get out of the EU, even though England has always been a major player in European history. This is because the English want traditionally to stand on a chair with three legs.  Right after the Second World War, British foreign policy was guided by the famous three-circle theory formulated by Winston Churchill earlier. In this scheme England was placed at the intersection of three circles. One circle contained only one other member, the United States of America, because of their \\u201cspecial relationship\\u201d. The other two circles contained the British Commonwealth and Continental Europe, respectively. With the incomprehensible decision of Jawaharlal Nehru to join the new Commonwealth after our Independence, this three-circle scheme of Churchill could be implemented in the new post-War world order.  In 1952 six contiguous countries in Europe, France, West Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, formed the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). Not surprisingly, England declined the invitation to join the club. When this Community was deepened and made into the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957, England again refused to join. However, by 1960 the advantages of the EEC membership were becoming apparent. Faster growth within the EEC relative to Britain forced some rethinking in the English business community. Soon thereafter Britain applied for membership to the EEC. In a historical veto, Charles De Gaulle denied British entry to the EEC in 1963. The document explaining the French \\u00a0non \\u00a0is still a fascinating one to understand fundamental differences between England and Continental Europe. Here is one representative paragraph: \\u201c(England) is maritime, she is linked through her exchanges, her markets, her supply lines to the most diverse and often the most distant countries; she pursues essentially industrial and commercial activities, and only slight agricultural ones. The means by which the people of Great Britain are fed and which are in fact the importations of foodstuffs bought cheaply in the two Americas and in the former dominions, at the same time giving, granting considerable subsidies to English farmers? These means are obviously incompatible with the system, which the Six have established quite naturally for themselves.\\u201d There were also other subtle factors. De Gaulle believed, perhaps rightly, that England would act as the US Trojan Horse within the community. Furthermore, he might have thought that the inclusion of Britain in the Community would hinder his ambition to be the natural leader of Europe.  After one more rejection by France in 1967, Britain finally was admitted to the EEC in 1975. Negotiations started in earnest only after De Gaulle died, and the entry was preceded by a positive vote in a referendum by the British voters in favour of Britain joining the Community. However, a large number of nay voters never accepted this decision. The issue also had no ideological underpinnings. Both major political parties, the Conservatives and Labour, were equally divided on the issue. The only consistent advocates in favour of the membership were members of the small Liberal party. British entry into the EU (then EEC) was a purely economic necessity. It signified England\\u2019s abandoning any pretence of being an independent world power. Their anti-European feeling is evident in the role they played within the EU during the last forty years. They have been a constant irritant in all EU decision-making processes, which reached its peak during the Thatcher era. The most dramatic was the demand for \\u00a0\\u2018rebate\\u2019 \\u00a0that Thatcher forced her European partners to agree to by threatening to get out of the EEC. Britain did not join the Euro, but continued demanding a place in decision-making meetings on the currency. They blackmailed other EU countries into agreeing to various unilateral opt-out clauses for Britain in the Maastricht and Lisbon treaties. They routinely hold up EU budget meetings to get the maximum concessions possible. This led some exasperated European leaders to whisper about a two-tier Europe, with a core group and the rest on the periphery. To accommodate the British demand, the European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, openly suggested this option recently to avoid an eventual Brexit.  The year-end summit agenda was dominated by the refugee crisis and an attempt to secure the entire border of the European Union. Cameron promised his countrymen that he would negotiate as vigorously as Thatcher did in 1984. He forced his colleagues to listen to his impassioned speech for forty minutes. At the end the main sticking point remained unresolved. The British proposals are now going to be negotiated in the next summit in the middle of February. The most difficult one that still remains is the British demand to discriminate against EU citizens migrating to the United Kingdom regarding their rights to benefit from the social welfare benefits of the new country of residence. This is never going to be granted, particularly by countries of East Europe. There may be some fudging over the issue, but whether the British public would buy that in making their voting decisions is far from clear. One of the latest post-summit opinion polls reported in the London newspaper, The Telegraph, is even more dramatic, with 47 per cent for a Brexit and only 38 per cent for Britain to stay in the European Union!  The late Rajinder Puri publicly appreciated my last article on England-EU relations, \\u201cCameron\\u2019s European Blunder\\u201d (The Statesman, July 4, 2014). It was a great honour for me.

The practices adopted in the view of accumulation of mass by the colonial rulers converted the peasants to bonded labourers once they failed to pay exorbitant taxes. This highhandedness of the British rule had also greatly impacted India\\u2019s indigenous systems of water management and harvesting.  Nevertheless, the local communities, particularly the peasantry, could have still sustained the age-old irrigation systems had they not been deprived of their financial resources by the new land revenue system of the British.  On this matter, the nationalist economic historian, Ramesh Chandra Dutt wrote, The dominions of the last Mahratta Peshwa passed under the British rule in 1817; and from that year the land revenue was continuously raised.  In 1817 the revenue realised from the newly acquired territory was 80 lakh, in 1818 it was raised to 115 lakh and in a few years more it came up to 150 lakh ... The village community system completely broke down under this pressure, the Raiyatwari system, introduced by Sir Thomas Munro, suggested the introduction of a similar Raiyatwari system in Bombay, ie, a system of separate settlements and individual cultivation.  On land settling operations in the Deccan and Gujarat, Romesh Dutt states further, Every effort was made lawful or unlawful to get the utmost out of wretched peasantry, who were subjected to torture, in some instances cruel and revolting, beyond description if they could not or would not yield what was demanded.  Numbers abandoned their homes and fled into neighbouring states; large tracts of land were thrown out of cultivation, and in some districts no more than a third of the cultured area remained in occupation.  On the whole, agricultural efficiency was grossly under decline during the British rule due to over exploitation. The land revenue was fixed at 50 per cent of the produce, but in some parts of India under British rule till 1855 or so, the proportion of land revenue to be paid to the government was even slightly higher, which clearly draws a picture of the extent of exploitation of the peasantry.  For example, in Madras Presidency in Raiyatwari areas, cultivation of around one-third of the irrigated area had been suspended, because land revenue in such areas exceeded the value of the gross produce.  The general condition of peasantry has not improved till now, though exploiters are not government but the middle men, local money lenders, bankers, and finally bureaucracy. The attitude of the bankers is purely commercial, because when it comes to lending money to the farmers, banks simply ignore the government guidelines.  The upkeep of traditional water resources was carried out by the local community, but with the decline of this dispensation, the colonial rulers found it highly difficult to manage them, because they were scattered over a large area.  Even the locally appointed zamindars could not be induced to carry out such repairs. Whichever area came under the rule of the British, sooner or later the village communities of that area were broken up.  This practice actually started during the Mughal rule, when the power of the village headman was seized and handed over to the bureaucratic agent of the emperor, and the job of tax collection was also handed over to the local agent of the emperor called a zamindar.  However, when the Mughal administration was strong, the village communities did not break up, but with the disintegration of the Mughal Empire, the welfare of the village communities was also neglected. With the degeneration of the local communities traditional water structures and irrigation systems also gradually eroded.  Once the zamindars also played a key role in maintaining peace and order as an agent of the king. To quote Romesh Chandra Dutt; \\u0085zamindars have not only been de facto landlords, but also de facto rulers within their own estates since the dawn of history.  They performed the same necessary and useful part in the history of Bengal, previous to the British rule, that the Barons of Europe performed or were supposed to perform, in the Middle Ages.  They preserved peace and order within their own estates, repressed crime and punished offenders, adjudicated cases and protected labourers and cultivators and represented and maintained the royal authority and influence.  The Permanent Settlement of 1793 of Lord Cornwallis perpetually fixed the revenue demand, which led to an upsurge in sub-infeudation, a hierarchy of revenue collecting rights was created, which led to extreme extortion of peasants. The result was disastrous for the local water bodies, lakes and ponds shrunk, channels were choked, tanks silted up and existing wetlands were overrun by farms.  All this mismanagement manifested in the form of Madras famine in 1877, and Lord Lytton was left with no option than to think of creating new resources for famine relief and insurance.  New taxes were introduced and a sum of Rs.1.5 lakh was fixed as famine grant, and an assurance was given to the Indian subjects that proceeds obtained from taxes would not be expended for any other purpose other than for which it was imposed.  But a pledge is always made to be broken, and the same fate awaited this pledge also, and very soon it was broken. The grant which was incorporated in the budget of 1878-79 was suspended in the budget of 1879-80.  In 15 years down, the earmarked famine relief fund amounted to Rs 22 crore, whereas actual fund sanctioned was only Rs 17.6 crore. It is also to be admitted that agencies of the British were always sincere in projecting the real picture, in this connection, the report of the Finance Commission of 1898 is worthy to be noted, With the best of intentions, British administration in India have repeatedly drifted into errors or forgotten their pledges because people themselves have been debarred from any real share in the administration.  In fact, the minor irrigation works were highly beneficial, though the British did not spend any money on their construction or repair. The total area irrigated through traditional minor irrigation systems was 7.44 lakh acres of land.  It is high time Indian government learnt the utility of traditional irrigation systems and conducted research to make them effective once again to save the country from the scourge of skewed and spatial rainfall pattern due to global warming.  Let our MPs individually adopt a particular rural area of their respective constituencies as a test case under Local Area Development scheme, and lo within a couple of years they will themselves note the effectiveness of renovated water bodies for the purpose of irrigation.  The government also must learn from the past experiences, construction of big dams or contemplating similar water shed projects are of no avail, because in the long run they will simply prove futile exercises due to heavy siltation and annual change in the rainfall pattern.  Under British, private irrigated areas constituted around 50 per cent of the total irrigated area in the country, which comprised largely tanks, wells, canals and small channels linked with streams or rivers, especially barricaded by inexpensive earthen dams.  The private irrigated area was quite extensive around 1.5 million hectares. However, this figure excluded the normally flooded areas, where floodwaters of the rains were withheld each year for a couple of months for irrigation erecting temporary embankments.  Still it is not too late; the government can encourage the local panchayats to construct such temporary embankments under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employee Guarantee Scheme annually to provide water for irrigation.  The Irrigation Commission in its report of 1901-03 stated that despite release of grants and loans for repair, construction and improvement of such water sources and providing technical knowhow for designing sluices, outlets and identifying such old sites of water bodies, zamindars never displayed any interest.  However, the government grants earmarked annually for extending irrigation facilities to farmers for railway lines development. The British government attached more importance to the development of railways than irrigation for the reason was mainly political.  The British government wanted to facilitate easy movement of army within the country. Even the British committed greatest blunder with the progress of its rule, when it gradually shifted its emphasis from traditional irrigation works such as tanks, wells, embankments and small river channels to canals having large command areas.  The objective of the British for giving emphasis on large irrigation works was to facilitate promotion of cultivation of export crops; they were least bothered whether local food production was enough to sustain India\\u2019s population.  Between 1920 and 1940, for instance, in the United Provinces and Madras, practically there was no increase in the area of private irrigation, rather the area shrank, and on the contrary government sponsored canal irrigation scheme recorded a rise of 83.71% and 11.7% in Uttar Pradesh and Madras respectively.  However, situation was different in the states not ruled by the British, for example, in old Hyderabad state the area irrigated by tanks increased up to the first half of the 20th century. The figure of tank irrigated area has gone up from 4500 hectares in 1895-96 to around 3.64 lakh hectares some forty years later.  Coochbehar is another example; the whole district of Cooochbehar was a land of dighis or artificially dug tanks. Therefore, the intensity and nature of irrigation in different areas entirely depended on the influence exerted by the local governments.  After independence gradually the traditional water harvesting structures have been rendered into disuse. Though billlions of rupees have been spent under MGNREGA for earth cutting, those old water bodies continuously remain neglected and disused. For example, in Jodhpur alone, more than 200 old water bodies are in a state of decline and decay.  Though canals are still flooded with water during rains, most of them are in a broken state and silted and many feeder tanks are in a state of utter neglect and disrepair. Many old baolis (tanks), called sagars locally, have been converted into dumping grounds by the civic authorities and locals..  However, times are changing. Today people are gradually becoming aware of the environmental crisis, but the main hurdle is our archaic system of laws and governance.  The British had drafted laws keeping in view their own colonial interests; though the new Constitution of India has been drafted, yet most of the laws governing India\\u2019s land, water and forests management were formulated by the British.  Moreover, Indian government contemplates to deal with environmental and other problems in the 21st century with the archaic 19th century laws and bureaucracy, though in terms of environmental laws, there has been some sporadic changes, which is at least can be dubbed as a good beginning.  The burning question is: will the Indian government continue to manage the rural setting with gilded bureaucracies, who always suffer from superiority complex and try to maintain a palpable distance between them and the general public, or relegate its management into the hands of rural communities? Further, every old laws devised by the British to ease their governance in India, needs to be rewritten, to suit the Indian setting.

Addressing his customary New Year press conference, Vaiko said the people were now opposed to both ruling AIADMK and DMK and expressed confidence about capturing power, riding on PWFs credibility.  Making corruption charges against both DMK and AIADMK, he said the constituents and leaders of PWF had no such complaints against them.  Citing the case of Delhi, he said AAP was given a resounding victory in the Assembly election although BJP had earlier managed an impressive performance in Lok Sabha polls, and Tamil Nadu could witness a similar situation where both Dravidian parties could be shown the door by voters.  Replying to a question, he said that in the state politics no party names the chief ministerial candidate prior to polls but the majority MLAs elect them post-election. PWF would follow such a method, he added.  PWF members were later slated to meet TMC leader G K Vasan, he said.  On the recent incident of DMDK leader Vijayakants alleged indecent behaviour with journalists, he said it could have been avoided.  Taking a dig at the ruling BJP at the Centre, he said the party had not implemented its promises even as he slammed incidents of alleged intolerance, including the killing of rationalists like Narendra Dabholkar.  Vaiko said the party paid the price in the Bihar election which it lost.

Every senior railway-person I meet seems to know of Shooter. I must confess I was ignorant. I had no idea he had a distinguished career (in various capacities) with the railways in Britain and was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year Honours List of 2010 for his services to the rail industry. Let me explain how and why I met Shooter.Three of India's mountain railways have obtained World Heritage status from the Unesco. Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR) got this status in 1999, Nilgiri Mountain Railway (NMR) in 2005 and Kalka-Shimla Railway (KSR) in 2008. An attempt from Matheran Hill Railway (MHR) for World Heritage status has been pending with the Unesco (the 2009 application failed and a new one is being processed). Two of these railways - Darjeeling and Matheran - are two feet narrow gauge. DHR was constructed in 1881 - it is the oldest of the mountain railways - and MHR in 1907. The rolling stock, including locomotives, is interchangeable between Darjeeling and Matheran. KSR, constructed in 1903, is narrow gauge with two and a half feet. NMR, constructed in 1908, is metre gauge and has a unique technology known as rack and pinion, which people come from around the world to see.Originally, all these railways were run on steam engines. Using steam locomotives is a condition for obtaining and retaining the World Heritage status. But Indian Railways (IR) no longer uses steam locomotives for trains that are time-tabled. The last time a time-tabled passenger train used steam locomotives was in Wankaner in Gujarat, in 2000. No one makes steam locomotives in India now. Chittaranjan Locomotive Works stopped producing steam locomotives in 1973 (that was broad gauge). Steam is no longer used because it is more expensive than diesel and electricity. The requirement of using steam traction to retain the World Heritage status is ensured through steam charters. That is, steam locomotives are used if one specially pays for them, or for joy-rides. Normal passenger trains on the mountain railways have diesel engines. This is despite tourists, especially foreign tourists who are fascinated by steam engines, willing to pay a premium for riding on steam trains. Tour operators say there is such a high-end market and are even willing to run private charter trains. The problem is that such niche heritage markets are not important for IR. It doesn't market them. Although a World Heritage status from the Unesco doesn't legally require a separate management entity, such a separate management entity is desirable, de-linked from IR. It can be called the Indian Heritage Railway Corporation, with some equity from IR, and can be in charge of all mountain railways. However, there should be no subsidies from IR. The three mountain railways must become profit-making entities.Once this is done, one can run trains on steam locomotives. Getting steam engines is a problem. They are not made in India any longer and there are few global producers. Each locomotive will also cost around Rs 2.5 crore. But there are steam locomotives that are still somewhere and these can be restored and reused. Getting a list is easier for mountain railways like DHR, whose fan club associations are more active. Out of 34 steam locomotives built for DHR, it still possesses 11, although only five are in working condition. The other six locomotives can be restored. The ones not with DHR are in different places - National Rail Museum, Tipong Colliery (North Eastern Coalfields), Tindharia Works, Dehradun railway station (plinthed), Lucknow railway station (plinthed), Rail Bhavan (plinthed), various workshops and divisional railway manager offices. Plinthed means they are on top of pedestals. They can be brought back into action. The ones in Tipong Colliery are used to haul coal. Only one DHR locomotive was taken out of the country. That went to an American museum (where it ran on Hesston Steam Railway) and now runs on a private steam railway, Beeches Light Railway, in Britain.That's how I chanced upon the name Adrian Shooter. He bought that DHR locomotive from the US in 2002 and restored it. He also owns Beeches Light Railway. Indeed, it operates out of his residence in Steeple Aston, Oxfordshire.

Beijing resorted to the move on major occasions, including during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in 2014.  The  Chinese capital, frequently hit by smog, has teamed up with the Tianjin  municipality and Hebei province to reduce air pollution.  In  December 2015, Beijing issued a red alert for smog - the first time  since 2013. The city government put in place its emergency vehicle  formula to tackle air pollution.  According to the formula, cars  with number plates ending with two different digits are not allowed on  any week day. Thus cars with number plates ending with 1 and 6 are  restricted on one day, those ending with 2 and 7 are disallowed on  another day. All cars are allowed to ply the road on Saturdays and  Sundays.  The formula is in place from\\u00a07 am to midnight.  Beijing  has said it will implement the odd-even rule on days the air quality  reaches the level of orange, the second highest alert level in China, or  is closer to the highest red level.  Besides such cars, vehicles  used to transport construction waste, tanker trucks and other heavy  trucks are also banned in the city on these days.  On days the air  quality reaches red alert level, 80 per cent of cars used by government  departments and state-owned enterprises are also ordered off Beijing\\u2019s  road.  The formula does not affect six types of vehicles \\u2013 police  cars, fire trucks, ambulances, engineering emergency vehicles, large  buses, taxis, and electric cars.  To tackle the difficulties of commuters, the Beijing government made elaborate arrangements.  The  Beijing metro system is one of the world\\u2019s largest. It has about 18  metro lines stretching up to 527 km touching 319 stations. It is the  world's busiest in annual ridership, with 3.41 billion trips delivered  in 2014.  The odd-even scheme was also tried out in Paris in March 2014 just for a day as an experiment to tackle air pollution.  In  1989, Mexico City introduced the move and saw air pollution drop 11 per  cent. However, people soon got round the move by purchasing two cars \\u2013  with odd and even numbers. It finally led to rise in air pollution.

While the goal of polio virus eradication is in sight, there are concerns about post-eradication manufacturing and stockpiling vaccine stores containing live virus that could escape and repopulate the environment.  Different types of polio vaccines currently exist, but none are optimal from a safety point of view.  Live attenuated (weakened) vaccine strains carry genetic mutations that prevent them from causing disease, but they can - in rare cases - revert to more dangerous virus.  There are also examples in which live attenuated virus can survive in the gut of immune-compromised individuals and can be shed into the environment through their feces.  Inactivated vaccines are themselves safe, but their production at present involves growing large amounts of wild-type (ie active virulent) virus that is then killed with a chemical called formalin.  After eradication, the World Health Organisation (WHO) plans to stop the use of live-attenuated polio vaccines.  WHO has strongly encouraged new manufacturers to switch the source of inactivated virus from virulent wild-type strains to an attenuated strain, named Sabin.  Arguing that the attenuated Sabin strain is unstable and therefore potentially problematic, Philip Minor, from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control in UK, and colleagues presented data on alternative attenuated strains which they propose as a safer alternative source for inactivated vaccine.  The researchers started with a Sabin vaccine strain whose attenuation and reversion has been extensively studied and is well understood.  Based on this knowledge, they modified a particular region of the viral RNA in ways that they predicted would make the resulting strains genetically stable.  They then compared these new strains with both the original Sabin vaccine strain and the wild-type strain currently used in the production of inactivated vaccine.  Besides testing the genetic stability of the new strains, the researchers examined their ability to grow in tissue culture (necessary for vaccine production), their risk for causing paralysis in mice carrying a human polio-virus receptor, and whether they effectively immunised rats.  Finally it was shown that these new strains were unable to infect primates by mouth. In all these tests, the new strains behaved as predicted, that is, they are effective, suitable to mass production, and safer than the alternatives.  \\","size":1},{"name":"The humble saffron has come to rescue people who are at the risk of  developing liver cancer.

Nepal is facing acute shortage of energy in the wake of the blockade of the Indo-Nepal border by Madhesis, largely of Indian-origin. Many people in the urban areas are relying on electricity due to the shortage of cooking gas.  The country is currently importing 235 MW of electricity from India.  Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) has made necessary preparations to acquire 90 MW of electricity.  The installation of Dhalkebar-Mujjafarpur inter-country transmission line is about to complete in a month and a technical test required for the same is in progress to import power to the country towards the end of this month, said Kanahiya Lal Manandhar, head of NEA transmission line.  Nepal has signed a power trade agreement with India last year which facilitate the country to import additional power from the southern neighbour.  The import of additional power is expected to ease the current power outage facing the country.  Nepal currently produces around 780 MW electricity though the domestic demand stands at 1,300 MW during peak period.  Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli has during a function in Kathmandu said that the government is working towards ending the power outage within a year and for that solar power, among other alternatives would be explored.

This should incrementally increase the pollution load.  In addition, one may see old more polluting vehicles being plied on the roads since citizens need to even their lives on odd days. Experts also fear that people who can afford may actually buy more vehicles so causing a spike in car numbers. May be the Delhi government seeks to mop up more one time lump-sum road tax collection revenues.  It is reported that the odd-even formula for rationing vehicles on roads whenever it is implemented to clean the dirty air over Paris, the city authorities in France attract the citizens to public transportation by making it free of charge.  May be the next populist measure the Aam Aadmi Party government of Delhi could implement is to make travel on the Delhi Metro and the Delhi Transport Corporation free for the days when road rationing is implemented.  As Sunita Narain of the Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi, points out that the National Capital Region (NCR) houses the countrys worst polluting Badarpur Power Station that incidentally continues to operate and ironically the countrys cleanest thermal power station located at Bawana in the NCR remains shut down since there is shortfall of Piped Natural Gas.  A drop in a few percentage points of air pollution may actually not be noticeable at all if one were to factor in weather patterns since such small variations happen on a daily basis depending on whether there is strong surface wind that dilutes the pollution by sweeping it away into the hinterland.  M Rajeevan, an atmospheric scientist and Secretary of the Ministry of Earth Sciences, New Delhi, says not enough is known quantitatively on how air pollution dilutes in the atmosphere over Delhi since the contribution of weather and wind in dispersing toxic gasses in the chaos of the tropical atmosphere over Delhi remains a mysterious unknown X-factor.  The well-intentioned thrust to control air pollution by the Delhi government may actually boomerang since the desired results of controlling air pollution may not be forthcoming since quick fix solutions tend to breakdown as easily.  Moreover, if the citizens cooperate whole-heartedly with Kejriwal and they still do not witness a perceptible drop in pollution levels, they would be highly dejected. A flagging public support would augur very badly in the long-term effort at controlling the killer air that is poisoning our lungs.  Therefore, solution to pollution is not dilution but a long-term well thought-out strengthening of the already quaking public transport system of the National Capital Region. PTI COR ZMN AAR","size":1},{"name":"Pallava Bagla for PTI on pollution in Delhi. Please carry his byline and give credit to PTI) Delhis killer air: Better public transportation a solution  By Pallava Bagla  New Delhi, Jan 1 (PTI) There is no doubt that the killer air is causing a slow poisoning of Indias capital. Nevertheless, the quick fix solution to pollution is not dilution. There is no doubt that New Delhi needs to reduce its air pollution but to an analytical mind the odds that the odd-even vehicle rationing system unilaterally imposed by Chief Minister  Arvind Kejriwal  may not bring about the desired results in quantitatively controlling air pollution.  At the turn of the century when Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) was introduced on orders of the Supreme Court, the killer air over Delhi indeed cleared out, but then such a clinically radical measure was just not being attempted but a tame politically correct solution was being tried.  Ideally, the only solution is to make public transportation cheap and convenient so that Indias love affair with diesel-fired cars is curbed.  If one looks at the source apportionment study of air pollution put together by civil engineer Mukesh Sharma from IIT, Kanpur, one finds that vehicles are not the biggest culprit for causing air pollution; but dust -- mostly road and construction dust -- is the devil.  Two thirds of the particulate matter below 10 microns or PM-10 can be attributed to dust and about 40 per cent of the PM 2.5 is accounted by road dust. Vehicles at best contribute between 9-20 per cent of the PM-10 and PM-2.5 levels respectively, so vehicles are really not the worst polluters.  If one further analyses data from the IIT-Kanpur study which itself still remains a draft report and who knows how the data may change. Among the entire vehicular population of Delhi, the biggest polluters are trucks contributing about half the pollution followed by two-wheelers that contribute two-thirds of the pollution. Four wheelers contribute only a tenth of the pollution of Delhi.  To take the odd-even rationing formula a bit further at best half of the four-wheelers will be off the roads between 8 am and 8 pm in the first half of January. This should theoretically reduce the pollution load caused by four wheelers by half, but then since they are not the biggest villains to expect that the air would be cleaner really needs a quantum jump in imagination.

For while HAL is putting on a \\u201cshow\\u201d during its anniversary celebrations, its functioning still reflects the shortcomings of a state-owned monopoly.

The polls to the civic body in Hyderabad assume significance in view of the size and demographic profile of the city.  There are as many as 24 Assembly constituencies under the GHMC limits with a population of about 65 lakh. There have been allegations that the number of voters exceeded the population in GHMC.  The GHMC polls, likely to be held in the coming few weeks, are a litmus test for the ruling TRS as the party has not been known to be a major force in the city.  TRS did not contest the last GHMC elections in 2009 and is keen to win the coming elections to prove its complete domination in Telangana.  A majority of assembly segments under GHMC limits have been won by the opposition TDP-BJP nominees though some of the TDP MLAs switched loyalty to the TRS.  The TRS had kicked off its campaign for the poll much ahead of its rivals with a number of hoardings on the governments achievements installed at different locations in the city.  The TRS government had also announced property tax exemption for certain sections and other decisions like regularisation of contract staff and fresh recruitment in government departments.  In an informal chat with mediapersons, Telangana IT and Panchayat Raj Minister K T Rama Rao, son of Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, today said the TRS government has put the city firmly on the path of making it a world-class city.  Amid opposition allegations that TRS had earlier intimated the Seemandhra natives in the city, Rama Rao had earlier sought to reach out to them, saying that no unwanted incident against them has taken place since the formation of Telangana.

The formalities for a tie-up between BJP and United People's Front (UPF), a forum of nine tribal and indigenous organisations that will contest 30 seats in the 2016 Assembly polls, are now being worked on. The first step towards this direction was a meeting on December 5 between Modi and Hagrama Mohilary, the chief of Bodoland People's Front (BPF), the prime force behind the tribal forum. Interestingly, BPF, which has 10 seats in the current Assembly, was part of the Congress-led Assam government between 2006 and 2014. In fact, the 2016 Assam Assembly polls will be a story of old friends joining forces against each other. Himanta Biswa Sarma, the one-time trusted lieutenant of Chief Minister  Tarun Gogoi  joined BJP in August and has emerged as the prime challenger to the 14-year-long Congress rule in the state. It was Sarma who took Mohilary to meet the prime minister. To counter Sarma, who happened to be strategist-inchief for Congress in 2006 and 2011 Assembly polls, Gogoi has recently roped in professional election manager Prashant Kishor, who has been widely credited for  Nitish Kumar 's return to power for third time in November. The deal between Kishor, who had a brief stint in  Rahul Gandhi 's office earlier, and Congress was reportedly struck by Nitish Kumar. The fact that Kishor's wife hails from Assam also helped as Gogoi was the first to reach out to Kishor's fatherin-law, immediately after the Bihar election results. As a foil to Kishor, the BJP has now enrolled services of Rajat Sethi, a former aide of Kishor.

There were changes in some organisations, rebellions and allegations of corruption that rocked the polity. The Opposition in Parliament was unyielding and key legislations were derailed. The Narendra Modi government appeared to be on the back foot.  With several states going to polls in 2016, and the Opposition looking formidable, what lies ahead?  thestatesman.com  takes a look at the political parties in the New Year.  \\u00a0Will lotus shine bright?  In 2015, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had a tough time as it lost in key elections in Delhi and Bihar. It was not really what party\\u2019s national president Amit Shah expected: The high-decibel campaigning led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was supposed to ensure BJP\\u2019s victory. While that didn\\u2019t happen, the party is now gearing up for the next round of state elections in 2016.  However, the party organisation is not strong in most of these states -- West Bengal, Kerala and Assam being the prime examples. Moreover, the Narendra Modi government must deliver on the promises of good governance. So far, the Modi government has failed to bring about any effective change in the social and economic sectors. Unless the Modi government manages to put governance back on track, living up to its promises of \\u201cache din\\u201d and drive that message to the people, it won\\u2019t be an easy ride in 2016 as well.  The BJP top brass will also have to deal with the domination of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as well as rein in the motormouth leaders who keep making controversial statements that have not gone down well with the people in general.  The Modi government will also have to try to get key legislations passed --- the Goods and Services Tax Bill being the most important reform bill among them. Which means the government will have to get the Opposition (read the Congress) on board. It remains to be seen whether the Grand Old Party plays the role of a constructive opposition or continues with its obstructionist ways.  A rejuvenated RaGa, but not enough  After the massive rout in the Lok Sabha elections of 2014, the Congress was looking forward to 2015, hoping that things will look up for them. The year began on a bleak note: The party was routed in Delhi Assembly election. But the results of the Bihar Assembly election later in the year came as a relief, with the party winning 27 seats of the 41 it contested. And more importantly, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi found his voice. His relentless attacks on the Modi government, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ensured that the country took notice. With just 44 MPs in Lok Sabha, Rahul and party president Sonia Gandhi gave the NDA government a hard time. \\u00a0Key bills were blocked, derailing the Modi government\\u2019s much-vaunted reforms agenda.  Amid all this it is expected that a rejuvenated Rahul Gandhi will take over the reins of the party from her mother in 2016. But will that be enough? The Congress is facing state elections, crucially in Assam and Kerala where it is the ruling party. The Congress won\\u2019t like to suffer a defeat ala Delhi, though there\\u2019s huge anti-incumbency against the governments in both the states. The party will also have to deal with the National Herald case in which Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have been named as the accused. So, despite its high-pitched opposition in Parliament, the Congress will have to work much harder to win back the trust of the people. And that\\u2019s not easy.  Socialists cannot rock the Janata boat  In Bihar, the two old rivals -- Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad Yadav -- came together to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party. Both Nitish and Lalu formed an alliance that was unthinkable even a few years ago. With the added support of the Congress, the Mahagathbandhan of Janata Dal-United, Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress won handsomely in the state Assembly election in 2015, defeating the saffron alliance under the BJP.  But the one party which drew blank was the Samajwadi Party which broke ranks with Nitish and Lalu. Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav didn\\u2019t pay heed to the bait of becoming the chief of a grand Janata Parivar --- the union of all the Janata parties. But with the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election slated in 2017, the Samajwadi Party may have to do a rethink on its strategy. It remains to be seen whether it chooses the path of merger with other Janata parties, a strategic alliance with secular outfits or prefers to be on its own.  So far as Nitish and Lalu are concerned, they have to do a balancing act in Bihar. There could friction, especially on the law-and-order front in Bihar: there are already murmurs of return of the \\u201cjungle raj\\u201d. \\u00a0Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will have to ensure that his government and the state or the party don\\u2019t suffer due to any such negative perception. And for Lalu, it is more important to keep the boat sailing smoothly because, as he said after the Bihar polls, his next target is Delhi.  Wary Amma may stay put  Acquitted from the disproportionate assets case, AIADMK supremo and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa is going strong. Her bonhomie with the BJP top brass is seen as a sign that things are fine between the state government and the Centre, something that may help her in the long run. However, the floods in the last half of 2015 were a setback for her; It dented her image quite badly. There have been allegations that she has been a chief minister who remained absent from the public view. It\\u2019s worrisome for sure for the Amma.  In this backdrop Jayalalithaa faces Assembly election in 2016. She has to battle all negative campaigning in the run-up to the elections and one of her ways would be to ensure that the flood reliefs reach the affected people. So far she has sanctioned hundreds of crores of rupees on this count which is being given to the victims through direct money transfer. She just has to deliver on governance, and that will ensure that she returns to power as is widely expected.  Didi breathing easy, may sail smooth  In West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was in deep trouble as her ministers and MPs got arrested in the Saradha chit fund scam in 2015. With more skeletons tumbling out of the closet, life looked extremely difficult for the Trinamool Congress supremo. Relations with the Centre were bitter over Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) actions in the scam. Mamata accused the Narendra Modi government at the Centre of vendetta. In that backdrop her relation with trusted lieutenant Mukul Roy also deteriorated. \\u00a0  However, things are looking bright as of now. Relations with the Centre and Roy have improved. It seems that despite the growing proximity between the Left and the Congress in the state, Mamata is all set to return to power in 2016 when she faces the Assembly election. Anti-incumbency factor may not just work against her despite BJP\\u2019s best efforts. She could sail smooth.  CPI-M banking on flexibility \\u00a0  For the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M), 2014 was a year for change. Sitaram Yechury became the party\\u2019s new general secretary. He\\u2019s not a hardliner like his predecessor Prakash Karat. And under the new skipper, CPI-M has decided to have \\u201cflexible tactics\\u201d to deal with the evolving political scene in the country.  The party continues to impact national politics even though it is not strong anymore in its one-time stronghold West Bengal.\\u00a0  However, both in West Bengal and Kerala -- the two states that are slated to go to polls in 2016 -- CPI-M is hoping that it will fare better than it did the last time. But, the fact is in Bengal there\\u2019s no strong leader in the party unit to steer the outfit. In Kerala there are those rebel elements that may dash the party\\u2019s hopes of resurgence.  2017 calculations on Behenji\\u2019s mind  The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) under Mayawati is keeping a low profile. True that it won around 700 zila panchayat wards after the Lok Sabha elections. However, in 2015, it fielded 237 candidates in the Bihar Assembly election but failed to win even a single seat.  So the party is now focusing on the larger picture. It is trying to consolidate the Dalit-Muslim vote bank ahead of the 2017 Assembly election in Uttar Pradesh. The party is also expected to counter the RSS machinations to appropriate the legacy of BR Ambedkar. \\u00a0  Aspirations of Aam Aadmi  After ascending to power in Delhi in 2015, Arvind Kejriwal\\u2019s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is going strong. However, the party is constantly battling the Union government, accusing it of interference in the affairs of the Delhi government. The constant war between the Centre and the Delhi government has got murky with Kejriwal alleging \\u201cvendetta\\u201d after the Central Bureau of Investigation raids on the Delhi Secretariat.  In 2016, the party will try to strengthen itself in terms of governance and organisation, keeping the municipal polls in mind. But it has to battle the perception that there is no internal democracy in AAP as was alleged by senior party functionaries who were later expelled.  Away from all that the party\\u2019s focus will be on the Punjab Assembly election. The party is hoping that it will be able to win the hearts and minds of voters there; Arvind Kejriwal is all set to launch the party\\u2019s campaigning in Punjab on January 14 with a mega rally at Muktsar. \\u00a0","size":1}]},{"name":50,"children":[{"name":"Ghaziabad, Dec 31 (PTI) Swami Chakrapani Maharaj, who had set afire a car that purportedly belonged to Dawood Ibrahim in Ghaziabad, today claimed that he has received death threats from the underworld don.

During arguments today, their lawyer citied various orders of the Supreme Court as well as High Court in this regard and argued that consent of the accused is necessary to conduct lie detection test.  NIA produced a total of six accused in the Court after the expiry of their remand. Besides the trio, the others are Mohsin Khan, Mohammad Altaf and Nisar Ahmed.

The two BJP leaders - Shirish Bangali and Pragnesh Mistry - were shot dead by two unidentified gunmen in Bharuch, about 200km from here, on November 2.  Bangali was a former President of Bharuch district unit of BJP, while Mistry served as General Secretary of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha.

The accused, identified as Khem Singh (34) and Hem Raj (35), both residents of Himachal Pradeshs Mandi district, have been arrested while they were allegedly processing a huge supply meant for rave parties on New Years eve in Delhi and Mumbai, a senior police officer said.  Based on a tip-off, the police arrested the duo from Delhi on Christmas eve and recovered from their possession around 3 kg hashish and 100 Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)-soaked stamp papers, allegedly meant to be sold at a price between Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 per stamp, the officer said.  This was the fourth LSD haul by Delhi Police. In July, the Narcotics Unit of Crime Branch had recovered around 270 LSD stamps with the arrest of a youth from Delhi.  In December 2014, the police arrested a duo, including a foreign national, from Delhi and recovered around 1200 LSD stamps from their possession.  During interrogation, Singh and Hem Raj told police that they were initially hashish addicts themselves and often used to exchange hard drugs for hashish with foreign tourists, leading them to a network of LSD.  Recently, they had exchanged around 3 kg hashish for 250 LSD stamps, and the recovered stamps are a part of that procurement, the senior officer added.

Besides, depositories will have to put in place systems for capturing the shareholding data of trading members or their associates and agents and ensure that there is a mechanism for coordination between the depositories towards sharing of information.  A mechanism would need to be put in place providing for approval of the listed stock exchange as and when holding of trading members\/associates\/agents reaches 45 per cent.  In case they purchase shares without requisite approval, the depositories will initiate consequential action such as freezing of voting rights and all corporate benefits in respect of such stake till the time the same is divested.

The year also witnessed two new secretaries -- Sekhar Basu of Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and A S Kirankumar Department of Space (DoS) -- taking charge.

India also launched ASTROSAT satellite, its first space research observatory, something which only the US, Russia, the EU and Japan has.  But more striking was ISROs achievement of launching foreign satellites. This year, Indias space arm launched six Singaporean satellites, four from the US, five from the UK and one from Canada and Indonesia each. This also heralded a new era for ISRO as India faced an embargo from the US post nuclear test in 1973 and 1997, which hampered its space programme.  For its work, including the success of Mars Orbiter Mission, Indias first inter-planetary mission, ISRO was awarded the Gandhi Peace Prize and Space Pioneer Award by US- based National Space Society.  However, ISRO also had its share of controversies. In September, an international tribunal asked Antrix, ISROs commercial arm, to pay USD 672 million to Devas in the controversial Antrix-Devas case.  There were complaints about the manner in which the deal was entered into and the way in which it was being operationalised. In 2011, the Centre had annulled the controversial deal between the Antrix Corporation and Bangalore-based Devas Multimedia.  On the other hand, the nuclear sector saw resolution to major impending issues.  Ahead of President Barack Obamas visit to India as Republic Day chief guest of 2015, India addressed the concerns raised by domestic as well as foreign players on the clauses of Civil Liability Nuclear Damages Act 2010. Following this, a Nuclear Insurance Pool was formed and operationalised.  The passage of the amendment to the Atomic Energy Act 1962 in the Winter Session of Parliament for enabling NPCIL to enter into joint ventures with other PSUs, will help expand nuclear energy production in India.

However, some uranium mines belonging to Uranium Corporation of India Ltd (UCIL), a PSU under DAE that provide raw nuclear fuel, saw closure due to lack of necessary permissions.  Interestingly, with commissioning of another unit of Kudankulam of 1000 MW and 500 MW of Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor in Kalpakkam, the new year will also witness a lot of activity in the nuclear sector. This will augment 1500 MW of more electricity from nuclear. India is also expected to see signing of agreement between US WestinHouse Co for building six reactors at Chhaya Mithi Virdhi in Gujarat.  In the space sector, apart from launching of scheduled satellites, ISRO is trying to ensure that the SAARC satellite, a gift to the neighbouring countries, is launched in December 2016, as announced by Modi. India is yet to get authorisation letter from countries like Pakistan and Nepal for the project.

While the traditional areas of life insurance and pensions are still at the heart of the actuarial profession, general insurance, investment and risk management are seeing very strong growth, indeed general insurance is now the second most popular area for the student base.\\u00a0  There are basically three societies all over the world providing actuarial courses in India. These include, Institute of Actuaries in India, Institute and Faculty of Actuary, UK and Society of Actuaries of USA. The present system allows and encourages students to opt for inter-examination among the IAI and IFoA societies. A fellow member of The Institute of Actuaries of India is referred as an actuary. This membership is achieved by passing examinations at various stages and fulfilling other conditions as required from time-to-time.\\u00a0  The examinations can be taken after being enrolled as a member. A graduate with a major subject in mathematics, statistics, econometrics, engineering and actuarial sciences are required to enroll. To become an associate or fellow of the IFoA, students must pass exams, complete a number of practical modules, and acquire a satisfactory level of work-based skills, which means that the average qualification time is currently three to six years. Also, for those who may not aspire to become an associate, there is the CAA qualification and membership grade \\u2014 the first actuarial membership qualification at this level in the world. \\u00a0 \\u00a0  \\u201dEvery business is subject to risks so an actuarial career offers many options. Understanding how businesses operate is vital for actuaries, but what really set them apart are their strong technical skills. \\u00a0Even more important is their ability to apply this to real business issues and to communicate difficult topics to non-specialists. Regulators are also seeking comfort in the skills of individuals at all levels in financial services and employers are looking to improve standards and fulfill their regulatory obligations,\\u201d said Saket Saraogi, career ambassador, Institute and Faculty of Actuary, United Kingdom and founder, Scube Tutorials, Kolkata. Many actuarial job opportunities exist in India and there are three areas where it is most in demand. This includes, traditional actuarial roles in the insurance industry, working for multinational insurance companies and actuarial consulting firms in the outsourcing set ups and non-traditional areas that are expanding such as risk management and information technology.\\u00a0  The numbers of students are even higher. Currently 57 per cent of student members are based outside the UK, with 22 per cent of those based in India. Research of the employment market suggests that those who hold a professional actuarial qualification can often command a salary premium because of their regulatory framework. \\u00a0In India, as in many countries around the globe, there is an increase in demand for skilled actuaries as multinationals grow and expand their businesses into new territory. \\u00a0If you have the mathematical and analytical interest that is at the core of the actuarial profession, you will find a very rewarding and varied career at the heart of the financial.  \\u201cThe problem is that many people are unaware of the course, and often we find students who themselves aren\\u2019t well versed with the details of the course. Also, not many people know how to prepare themselves for the test and be successful. With this view in mind, we have come out with Scube Tutorials, where we provide actuarial science tuition at extraordinarily low costs by utilising innovative methods. We provide correct tools to clear the actuarial exams. We understand that every student is special and has a different need and capacity to learn. We have a panel of teachers who specialise in their subject and provide classroom training for CT series and Actuarial Common Entrance Test,\\u201d Saraogi added.

The 57-year-old Chairman of Sadbhawana Party, one of the four Madhes-based political parties that have launched an agitation in southern Nepal under the banner of United Democratic Madhesi Front, has left for New Delhi for medical treatment, according to Vice president of the party Laxaman Lal Karna.  The senior Madhesi leader was initially airlifted from Dharan, where he was undergoing treatment for the past week, to the capital Kathmandu, from where he was again airlifted to Delhi.  The leader, who had sustained injuries including on head during a clash between the largely Indian-origin Madhesis and police at Biratnagar-Jogabani border check-point on December 26, was flown to Delhi as his health condition could not improve much even after staying in the ICU for some time, Karna told PTI.  He was injured during baton charging by the police as he was leading a group of Madhesi cadres for a sit-in to blockade movement of vehicles in the border area.  The police had baton charged the agitators and fired teargas shells to disperse them.  The senior Madhesi leader had spent over a week while undergoing treatment at a local hospital in Biratnagar and Dharan-based B P Koirala Institute of Health Sciences.  Mahatos blood pressure and sugar level were also found to be higher than normal.  He had fallen unconscious for some time while undergoing treatment, sources close to him said.  Mahato, along with three other senior Madhesi leaders, had travelled to Delhi for political consultation last month and held talks with senior Indian leaders including External Affairs Minister  Sushma Swaraj .  Madhesis have resorted to aggressive protests after Mahato sustained injuries and have demanded action against the security personnel involved in the incident.  Madhesis are agitating over the new Constitution demanding more representation. They are also protesting division of their ancestral homeland under the seven-province structure and have led an ongoing blockade of key border trade points with India.

An earlier plea by Bhangoo, one of the main promoters of the PACL group which includes companies like Pearls Agrotech Corp Ltd and Pearls Golden Forest Ltd (PGFL), is already pending before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT).

The team from Pennsylvania State University used Fast Radio Bursts (brief blasts of rare radio signals from space) which are 10-100 times better than previous testing methods that used gamma-ray bursts.  The new method is considered to be a significant tribute to Einstein on the 100th anniversary of his first formulation of the Equivalence Principle which is a key component of Einstein's theory of General Relativity.  \\u201cWith abundant observational information in the future, we can gain a better understanding of the physical nature of Fast Radio Bursts,\\u201d said Peter Meszaros, professor of Physics at Penn State.  More broadly, the new method is a key component of the concept that the geometry of spacetime is curved by the mass density of individual galaxies, stars, planets and other objects.  Fast Radio Bursts are super-brief blasts of energy -- lasting just a few milliseconds.  Until now, only about a dozen Fast Radio Bursts have been detected on Earth.  They appear to be caused by mysterious events beyond our Milky Way Galaxy and possibly even beyond the galaxies that includes the Milky Way.  The new technique will be important for analysing the abundance of observations of Fast Radio Bursts that advanced radio-signal observatories, now being planned, are expected to detect.  Like all other forms of electromagnetic radiation including visible light, Fast Radio Bursts travel through space as waves of photon particles.  With the new method, \\u201cwe will also be able to use Fast Radio Bursts as a probe of their host galaxies, of the space between galaxies, of the cosmic-web structure of the universe, and as a test of fundamental physics\\u201d, Meszaros explained.  Einstein's Equivalence Principle requires that any two photons of different frequencies, emitted at the same time from the same source and traveling through the same gravitational fields should arrive at Earth at exactly the same time.  If Einstein's Equivalence Principle is correct, any time delay that might occur between these two photons should not be due to the gravitational fields they experienced during their travels, but should be due only to other physical effects.  \\u201cBy measuring how closely in time the two different-frequency photons arrive, we can test how closely they obey Einstein's Equivalence Principle,\\u201d the authors noted.

Scientists have known for years that carbon dioxide (CO2) from the burning of fossil fuels has been warming the planet. The just-concluded meeting in Paris urged nations to cut their CO2 emissions to ensure that the global temperature does not rise more than 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level, while aiming for a 1.5 degree limit.  But some experts, like law professor Dan Farber of the University of California-Berkeley, doubt whether even the 2 degree goal can be achieved purely through emission cuts, suggesting other avenues must be explored.  India has indeed an additional option, some geologists believe. This consists of capturing the CO2 coming out of coal-fired power plants and injecting it below the Deccan Traps for permanent storage.  Deccan Traps - a thick pile of solidified lava from volcanic eruptions 65 million years ago - occupies about a third of peninsular India and is the world's largest continental flood-basalt province outside Siberia. The trap cover varies in thickness from a few hundred to a few thousand metres and, below this, lie thick sedimentary rocks.

Authorities reported a footfall of 15,000 in one day alone. The long Christmas weekend coupled with beautiful, sunny days in the winter made Jaipur the perfect getaway from the polluted air in the national capital.With its history, classic architecture, good infrastructure, welcoming attitude and superb food, Jaipur continues to be an important tourist destination. The Delhi-Agra-Jaipur triangle is a favourite with foreign tourists as well.While its history and palaces continue to hold fort as the biggest tourist attractions, it is Jaipur's delectable food that really makes one swoon. It requires a huge appetite and loads of time to be able to sample what is on offer in its various corners.From breakfast at one of the lassi shops on Mirza Ismail Road to a visit to Rawat Mishthan Bhandar for the pyaaz or mawa kachori, kadha doodh and jalebi, to paying obeisance at the legendary Laxmi Mishthan Bhandar, Jaipur can make you beg for a bigger appetite - because you may also want to try the dal baati choorma or the classic Rajasthani thali with numerous small portions of local delicacies. Non-vegetarians need not despair, for there is Handi with its lal maans and tandoori chicken that can keep them satiated. You could also go to Virasat or Chokhi Dhani for a traditional Rajasthani experience. Both are designed to satisfy the tourists' craving to get photographed in a typical Rajasthani mileu. At Virasat, there is even a throne where you can sit wearing a safa and get clicked. You marvel at the acumen of the owners of the place for having thought it up while wide-eyed tourists get clicked around you.What makes Jaipur tick like this? Is it just the quality of the food? If history and quality of food was the case, then Indore too would feature in this list - but it doesn't.Having visited both Jaipur and Indore recently, I can safely say that Indore probably has the best street food in India. Imagine a city with two markets dedicated to street food: Chappan Dukaan during day time and Sarafa Bazar at night. Sarafa comes alive at 9 pm when all the jewellers shut shop, and stalls are set up - and it keeps buzzing till the wee hours. While Jaipur with its kachori, mirchi-vada or mithai is rightly celebrated, Indore is strangely missing from this conversation about desi snacks. Unlike north India, Indore understands breakfast and does it well. One can stop at any of the small shops or shacks around this city for a five-minute breakfast of Indori poha, often served on a piece of newspaper with a steel spoon. Then tea, which is consistently good at any shop in Indore.One needs to visit Sarafa twice. It needs a visit during the day to be able to sample Nagori's legendary shikanji, which unlike north India is not a drink made of lemon juice, sugar and water but is something like liquid kulfi - with some sellers even using yoghurt to give it a different taste. The day visit is also needed to meet another legend in the same market at Joshi Dahi Bada, who is an artist and makes the best dahi vadas that you would find anywhere. With his showmanship, he turns a serving of a simple dahi vada into theatre. The greatest secret that Indore's streets have is something else though: it is called bhutte ka kees, and is made using grated corn, milk, lemon, coconut and the mildest of spices. What makes Indore's street food special is that the Indoris know how to use sugar in their food. So both poha and bhutte ka kees have a mild use of sugar that does not overpower the taste, but takes it to another level.As the erstwhile capital of the Holkars, Indore has enough history around it to be a good tourist destination. The Rococo-style palace at Lal Bagh is one of the most beautiful palaces in India, with opulence that can amaze you but requires urgent and massive restoration. One can also visit Mandu with its fort or the town of Maheshwar, the home of the Maheshwari silk sarees, on the banks of the serene Narmada river which used to be the capital of the Holkars before it was moved to Indore in 1818 AD.Jaipur and Indore are two cities that have a lot of similarity - with a rich history, booming trade and exceptional food. It makes you wish the Delhi-Agra-Jaipur triangle was actually a quadrilateral with Indore being the fourth corner.","size":1},{"name":" Five persons were killed on Friday and 12 others injured after a bus they were travelling in collided with an oil tanker on Jodhpur-Jaisalmer highway at Jhanwar town, police said here.

The high court is currently hearing a bunch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the beef ban legislation in Maharashtra. In February 2015, the President had granted sanction to Maharashtra Animal Preservation (Amendment) Act.

The DB while upholding Rule 111 of the Police Rules observed that Prosecuting Officers are part of the Police Department. \\u201cThe plea of the State Government that Police Rule 111 is applicable to Prosecuting Officers and entire Police Force is upheld\\u201d, the DB said.Since the seniority of Prosecuting Officers was altered without issuing notice to the aggrieved persons in 2008, the DB said, \\u201cthe non-issuance of notice to the writ petitioners whose seniority was finally determined after calling for objections with regard to the provisional seniority list after giving temporary promotion to some of them that too after several years on the facts and circumstances of these cases have vitiated the orders of re-fixing the seniority\\u201d.\\u201cThe writ appeals are disposed of and the order of the Single Judge is affirmed insofar as allowing the writ petitions and quashing the re-fixation of seniority is concerned\\u201d, the DB said.","size":1}]},{"name":65,"children":[{"name":"Raipur, Jan 1 (PTI) Two naxals were gunned down and three others arrested today following a fierce gun-battlebetween the Maoists andsecurity forces in restive Abhujmad area of Chhattisgarh Narayanpurdistrict.

The plea was rejected by Principal Judge P B Desai, presiding over the Special NIA Court here, after the accused - Haji Patel, Mohammad Yunus Shaikh and Abid Patel - declined to give consent to undergo polygraph test.  During arguments today, their lawyer citied various orders of the Supreme Court as well as High Court in this regard and argued that consent of the accused is necessary to conduct lie detection test.  NIA produced a total of six accused in the Court after the expiry of their remand. Besides the trio, the others are Mohsin Khan, Mohammad Altaf and Nisar Ahmed.  As the Central agency did not seek further remand, the court sent all the accused in 14-day judicial custody.  The two BJP leaders - Shirish Bangali and Pragnesh Mistry - were shot dead by two unidentified gunmen in Bharuch, about 200km from here, on November 2.  Bangali was a former President of Bharuch district unit of BJP, while Mistry served as General Secretary of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha.  Initial probe by Gujarat Police revealed the contract for killing the BJP leaders was given allegedly by fugitive underworld don Javed Chikna, apparently to avenge communal riots in Mumbai and Gujarat in 1993 and 2002, respectively.

The UAVs employ high span chord ratio wings, however, tend to lose their manoeuvrability.

Variable thrust direction (VTD) technology is a type of thrust vectoring control (TVC) approach that allows to manipulate the directions of thrust to the fuselage of the aircraft.  Most of the existing works are designed for jet engines, which cannot be applied to the conventional propeller engine aircraft.  Researchers from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in China developed a novel VTD mechanism to the conventional propeller engine UAV, which allows redirecting parts portion of the thrust from the propeller engine to other directions rather than normal axial direction.  A combination flight controller for the VTD enhanced UAV is then proposed to coordinate the VTD controlled forces and aerodynamic surfaces forces.  The proposed variable thrust direction mechanism consists of a conventional propeller engine which is mounted on a two dimensional rotate disk driven by two servo actuators.  By combining the linear motions of the actuator, both the azimuth and the altitude angle of the disk with respect to the fuselage can be controlled, and thus changing the thrust direction of the propeller.

The poll, to gauge the mood of corporate India and its plans for the New Year, was conducted among 50 across India in the first fortnight of December.Corporate earnings, which have remained muted in the past few quarters, are expected to improve in 2016, say 68 per cent of the CEOs polled. They add this will mainly be fuelled by fresh government orders, low tax rates coming into effect from April 1, and spending. For many infrastructure projects, the CEOs say, a ramp-up that has already begun will give a fillip to steel, cement and construction companies. While nearly half the CEOs polled are not happy with the pace of economic reforms so far under the current government, 60 per cent agree that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious development agenda has been hijacked by fringe elements. The government struggled with its inclusive agenda in 2015, as several members of Parliament from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party made inflammatory statements against minority communities. This affected investors' confidence in India and sullied the Modi government's image during the crucial Bihar election.Almost 60 per cent of the CEOs say they want the government to remove all restrictions on foreign direct investments (FDI), including those in single-brand retail and defence. This, they say, will bring fresh investments and create new jobs in the country.With the cap on in insurance being raised to 49 per cent in 2015, many Indian companies sold their stakes at good valuations to their joint venture partners.The top item on the CEOs' wish list for the New Year is on expected lines.

While the traditional areas of life insurance and pensions are still at the heart of the actuarial profession, general insurance, investment and risk management are seeing very strong growth, indeed general insurance is now the second most popular area for the student base.\\u00a0  There are basically three societies all over the world providing actuarial courses in India. These include, Institute of Actuaries in India, Institute and Faculty of Actuary, UK and Society of Actuaries of USA. The present system allows and encourages students to opt for inter-examination among the IAI and IFoA societies. A fellow member of The Institute of Actuaries of India is referred as an actuary. This membership is achieved by passing examinations at various stages and fulfilling other conditions as required from time-to-time.\\u00a0  The examinations can be taken after being enrolled as a member. A graduate with a major subject in mathematics, statistics, econometrics, engineering and actuarial sciences are required to enroll. To become an associate or fellow of the IFoA, students must pass exams, complete a number of practical modules, and acquire a satisfactory level of work-based skills, which means that the average qualification time is currently three to six years.

This includes, traditional actuarial roles in the insurance industry, working for multinational insurance companies and actuarial consulting firms in the outsourcing set ups and non-traditional areas that are expanding such as risk management and information technology.\\u00a0  The numbers of students are even higher. Currently 57 per cent of student members are based outside the UK, with 22 per cent of those based in India. Research of the employment market suggests that those who hold a professional actuarial qualification can often command a salary premium because of their regulatory framework. \\u00a0In India, as in many countries around the globe, there is an increase in demand for skilled actuaries as multinationals grow and expand their businesses into new territory. \\u00a0If you have the mathematical and analytical interest that is at the core of the actuarial profession, you will find a very rewarding and varied career at the heart of the financial.  \\u201cThe problem is that many people are unaware of the course, and often we find students who themselves aren\\u2019t well versed with the details of the course. Also, not many people know how to prepare themselves for the test and be successful.

And a fresh chapter in peace studies has been crafted at the conclusion of a year that bore witness to hideous instances of man\\u2019s inhumanity to man. This week\\u2019s happiness in a swathe of Asia shall not neutralise the torment in the Arab region and parts of Europe, however. South Korea and its former colonial master, Japan, have eventually concluded a pact on the historical dispute over Korean women who were forced to serve as sex slaves in Japan\\u2019s imperial army in the early 20th century. The \\u201ccomfort women\\u201d, so-called, have been a painful legacy of Japan\\u2019s rule over Korea (1910-45). The latter date is significant as it marks Japan\\u2019s defeat in World War II. A dark chapter in history can now be contextualised with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\\u2019s remarkably gracious remark, expressing \\u201capologies and remorse from the heart\\u201d. The ugly truth has clearly forced Japan to go on the defensive. As much is apparent from foreign minister Fumio Kishida admitting the Japanese government\\u2019s \\u201cresponsibility for recruiting comfort women with the involvement of the army and for severely injuring the honour and dignity of women\\u201d. It has been a historic moment of candour for the dispensation in Tokyo, verily a moral victory for women. Many of the victims of the era of \\u201ccomfort women\\u201d may no longer be around; those who are must now be in their eighties and nineties. Yet that ought not to detract from the significance of Tuesday\\u2019s agreement, which is essentially a compromise on the part of Abe. The Japanese government will provide $ 8.3 million (1 billion yen) to a foundation that the South Korean government will put in place to \\u201cheal the wounds\\u201d that women suffered during the inter-war years.  The striking feature of the rehabilitation package is that it will be funded directly from Japan\\u2019s national budget -a remarkable compromise not least because the previous Asian Women\\u2019s Fund was dependent on private donors and was never accepted by the government in Seoul. For all that, some among the 46 surviving women do have a point when they cavil that the deal stops short of Japan accepting what they call \\u201clegal responsibility\\u201d for recruiting \\u201ccomfort women\\u201d and setting up \\u201ccomfort stations on the frontline\\u201d, where the victims were \\u201ctreated as sub-human slaves for Japanese soldiers\\u201d. Nonetheless, the agreement does signify a new phase in bilateral relations, not least the resolve not to criticise each other over the issue at the United Nations. The world must hope that the curtain has come down on an ugly phase of history.\\u00a0","size":1}]},{"name":81,"children":[{"name":"As I spent the last days of 2015 travelling extensively in several drought-affected villages, I have some sense of what people I met recently would be thinking in the new year. Manjula in Materi village (Mau block) would be hoping that her husband and his brother who went away as migrant workers can somehow get their long-denied wages and return. She would also be praying for their recovery from serious undiagnosed illnesses.  In Kalchiha village, Ramjiyai would be looking at her five grand children sleeping half-hungry and wondering how long will be able to feed and clothe them on the small amount she earns as a mid-day meal cook. Their father toils in distant places that keep changing, while their mother died recently at a young age.  Kamlesh would be remembering his small, sick child he carried in his lap as he left his village in Banda district with his wife in search for work in distant areas. The child died half way into the bus journey.  In Oram village Shyama would try not to look at the tree in her courtyard from which her father (farmer turned migrant worker Munna Lal) hanged himself. She would be hoping that at least one of the several officials who promised help at the time of the tragedy would keep his word.  Munni Devi of the same village would be thinking why she allowed her son Anshu to work in the village\\u2019s fire cracker factory. She knew this to be very hazardous yet when hunger in the family became unbearable she had to agree to Anshu\\u2019s working there. There was an explosion and her son, the symbol of her hopes, was burnt to death. For her it is hard to find any hope in the new year so it is all the more important to try and bring at least a single ray of light into her dark world.  It is in places like these that our country has something to take pride in as despite all adversities, there are numerous examples also of dedicated work with the weakest sections and with distressed people. To give just a few examples, in remote villages of Chattisgarh doctors of the Jan Swasthya Sahyog travel regularly to very remote villages overcoming many hardships so that victims of TB, leprosy and cancer can get badly needed treatment.  Activists of Aman Biradari reach out to victims of communal violence to share and reduce their problems and isolation. Neglected children of schools in remote villages of Rajasthan find that their problems are now being heeded due to a campaign for improving government schools. Even in distant America, non-resident Indians get together to pool resources for reaching out to activists working with the genuinely needy sections of society.  Such efforts, in India and other parts of the world, have helped to keep alive our hopes, yet we have to also face the bitter truth that human folly has led to accentuation of serious problems. In many countries like Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya and Yemen, international interventions made in the name of democracy and other highly desirable objectives have actually worsened the situation, leading to more violence and death and displacement of several hundred thousand people.  Entirely avoidable conflicts are increasing at a time when there is greater need for peace and stability so that the most pressing survival issues like climate change and mass extinction of species can be resolved before it is too late. Time is running out fast, but instead of mobilizing the truly great efforts needed for the most important tasks, the 21st century world is still embroiled in conflicts relating to religion and race. While the most cruel manifestation of this is in the form of activities of ISIS and its affiliates, many other conflicts based on social discrimination and hatred also exist in many parts of the world.  At the root of the many conflicts is a strong urge for dominance and greed, which is all-too-evident even in international conferences and negotiations where it becomes increasingly clear that the richest and the most dominant have no intention of giving up their privileges and luxuries \\u00a0for a larger cause. For them, only those solutions for the earth\\u2019s most pressing problems are acceptable which do not challenge their privileged position. But such narrow solutions cannot bring real change, and so cannot obtain the much needed people\\u2019s participation. So while rhetoric rules, the most serious problems continue to pile up.  Where then is hope for 2016? It may not be very visible, but it nevertheless has a very significant presence in the millions of every day actions of ordinary people that rise above self-interest to help others in many small ways. Hope exists also in the thousands of sane voices that are raised almost every day for workable solutions to world\\u2019s problems.  How do we ensure that these millions of selfless small actions of people become the components of a well thought out and comprehensive effort to solve the world\\u2019s most pressing problems? How do we ensure that these thousands of sane voices can be brought together to create the framework of such a comprehensive plan?  It can be done. It is difficult but possible. And in such efforts lives the hope of the new year.

For this reason, it is nearly always wedding season at their house. The workday does not begin until sometime in the afternoon and it does not end until deep into the night \\u2014 after the guests have left the brightly lit venues, and the chairs and tables and lights and stages have been dismantled, to be set up again the next day for the next wedding.  Over the years, their wedding business has grown to gargantuan proportions with attention being given to the most microscopic of details. It is not a surprising development; as Pakistan\\u2019s cities have swelled with newer arrivals and the progeny of old inhabitants have grown to adulthood, betrothals are numerous and more resplendent.  There is, however, another reason for the ever-expanding numbers of businesses catering to the soon-to-wed. As the rate of rural to urban migration rises, and the expanding labour export market leaves many in a constant revolving process of arrival and departure, the family structures that sustained the marital celebration have all but disappeared.  The consequence, of course, is that weddings (and not simply the matches made) are transactional affairs.  It is far easier to pay someone to make the food, provide the music and set the stage; indeed, with money one can guarantee mirth and merriment of a sort that family relations never could. Those that are paid to be joyous and accommodating, after all, are much more reliable than the relations scarred by deceptions past, by inheritances denied \\u2014 all the dark realities that those hosting weddings are eager to forget.  And forget they do, thanks in part to those that have made weddings a business. With the once-loved ones duly sidelined, wedding organisers and planners will happily take over, ensure that the mehndi is arranged in glittering trays, the offerings for the bride, the perfume and the bangles, the shoes and the chocolate, are all arrayed on trays and wrapped up in tulle. Whatever gaps are left unfilled by the paid can be made up by friends enlisted over the years, whose weddings the now bride and groom have dutifully attended: the cashing in of favours past. If the now marrying have been lackadaisical in attending the mehndis, mayuns, nikahs and rukhsatis of others, the effects will be visible, usually on the dance floor. As all urban Pakistanis know, the number of dances to the latest Bollywood numbers, remixed rap anthems and revitalised oldies are all testaments to the popularity of the bride and groom.  The sweaty, dancing, hapless souls, happy on demand and desperate for a bit of the limelight, must participate in the mandatory merriment; it may be their best chance to snag a wife or husband of their own. A second rank may constitute the recently married, eager to exhibit the dribbles of youth that marital drudgery has not bled away, exhibiting the triumph of still fitting into the garments of one\\u2019s glory day.  Nearly everyone who reads this article will participate in such a spectacle in the short cool months, when large crowds are more easily amassed, fatty foods more easily consumed. Old saris will be dragged out per the retro themes of the day, itchy suits and over-garnished sherwanis stuck over bodies grown large between now and last December.  If the hirelings that have been employed to produce the wedding feast are well paid and honest, there will be biryani and korma and only mild heartburn. If not, the vapid consumption of grease-laden food will end with a long night, solitary payment for communal gluttony. Those are the physical risks, the psychological carnage of forgotten sisters, ignored cousins and so much else that has a cost all its own \\u2014 that accrues invisibly but inflicts its own mortal wounds, whose blood and gore lie just beneath the enforced joy.  The wedding is an emblem of culture, and the Pakistani culture, battered by decades of war and demographic change, stands changed. The Pakistani wedding, with its hollow adherence to custom and tradition, largely aped from television dramas and Bollywood sagas, is an attempt to patch up the holes and gaps of now with hired hands and self-serving friends. Underneath the mandatory merriment lies a torn social fabric that is not what it used to be and has little idea of what it wants to be.  A sincere commitment to maintaining familial relations requires more than attendance at weddings; it necessitates respect and a desire for love to mean more than the public proffering of hugs and kisses at nikahs and rukhsatis.  If the increasing numbers of monetary transactions involved in arranging a wedding, from the florist to the DJ, from the caterer to the venue manager, are any evidence, then it is money and not family that is of primary importance. With the former, the pretence of a happy family untainted by sibling cruelties and parental favouritism can be magically recreated at the wedding venue: a glittering bride and groom, a backlit stage, thumping music, all making up for the love and closeness that is no more.  The big wedding has long been a South Asian boast, and urban Pakistanis have begun to enact its grandiosity and faux sentimentality with the artifice of Bollywood productions. There are actors and actresses, some better than others; there are set designers and scriptwriters, choreography and music and, of course, heroes and villains.  There is one crucial difference though: the unreality of the Bollywood production is well known but the chicanery of the urban Pakistani wedding, its glittery gloss over frayed families, its garish re-enactment of cinematic scenes, insists that it is, in fact, the real, joyful, thing.

ISRO's satellites included two communication ones -- GSAT 6 and GSAT 7 -- and IRNSS-1D, the fourth of the seven satellites constituting the space segment of the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System.  IRNSS-1A, 1B and 1C, the first three satellites of the constellation, were successfully launched earlier. India also launched ASTROSAT satellite, its first space research observatory, something which only the US, Russia, the EU and Japan has.  But more striking was ISRO's achievement of launching foreign satellites. This year, India's space arm launched six Singaporean satellites, four from the US, five from the UK and one from Canada and Indonesia each. This also heralded a new era for ISRO as India faced an embargo from the US post nuclear test in 1973 and 1997, which hampered its space programme.  For its work, including the success of Mars Orbiter Mission, India's first inter-planetary mission, ISRO was awarded the Gandhi Peace Prize and Space Pioneer Award by US- based National Space Society.  However, ISRO also had its share of controversies. In September, an international tribunal asked Antrix, ISRO's commercial arm, to pay USD 672 million to Devas in the controversial Antrix-Devas case.  There were complaints about the manner in which the deal was entered into and the way in which it was being operationalised. In 2011, the Centre had annulled the controversial deal between the Antrix Corporation and Bangalore-based Devas Multimedia.  On the other hand, the nuclear sector saw resolution to major impending issues.  Ahead of President Barack Obama's visit to India as Republic Day chief guest of 2015, India addressed the concerns raised by domestic as well as foreign players on the clauses of Civil Liability Nuclear Damages Act 2010. Following this, a Nuclear Insurance Pool was formed and operationalised.  The passage of the amendment to the Atomic Energy Act 1962 in the Winter Session of Parliament for enabling NPCIL to enter into joint ventures with other PSUs, will help expand nuclear energy production in India.","size":1}]},{"name":89,"children":[{"name":"Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed on Friday expressed  grief over the tragic death of 10 construction workers in a fire  incident that engulfed their residential barracks in Ramban district of  the state.

Ceramics are tough and are used in everything from jet engines to Formula 1 race car brakes.  Ceramics offer many appealing qualities, including high-temperature stability, environmental resistance and high strength.  But unlike polymers and some metals, ceramic particles don't fuse together when heated.  The few 3D printing techniques that have been developed for ceramics have slow production rates and involve additives that increase the material's tendency to crack.  Zak Eckel, engineer at HRL Laboratories in Malibu, California, and colleagues were able to improve upon these processes by using silicon- and oxygen-based polymers that, upon polymerisation, trap the ultra-violet (UV) light so that additives are not needed for the UV curing steps.  Once the polymer is printed, the part is heated to a high temperature to burn off the oxygen atoms, thus forming a highly dense and strong silicon carbide product.  Using electron microscopy to analyse the end product, the researchers detected no porosity or surface cracks.  Further tests reveal that the ceramic material can withstand temperatures of 1,400 degrees Celsius before experiencing cracking and shrinkage and can be fabricated into complex, curved and porous shapes.  According to the authors, these developments, which also create a more efficient ceramic-production process, hold important implications for numerous high-temperature applications, such as in hypersonic vehicles and jet engines.  Their research appeared in the journal  Science.  \\u00a0","size":1},{"name":"Washington:\\u00a0                             Scientists, including one of Indian-origin, have successfully used a gene editing tool to treat a genetic disease in a fully developed living mammal for the first time, an advance that may be translated in humans. Researchers from Duke University in US used CRISPR to treat an adult mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. They had previously used CRISPR to correct genetic mutations in cultured cells from Duchenne patients, and other labs had corrected genes in single-cell embryos in a laboratory environment. But the latter approach is currently unethical to attempt in humans, and the former faces many obstacles in delivering treated cells back to muscle tissues. Another approach, which involves taking CRISPR directly to the affected tissues through gene therapy techniques, also faces challenges, particularly with delivery. Researchers including Aravind Asokan, associate professor at the University of North Carolina, overcame several of these obstacles by using a non-pathogenic carrier called adeno-associated virus, or AAV, to deliver the gene-editing system. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by problems with the body's ability to produce dystrophin, a long protein chain that binds the interior of a muscle fibre to its surrounding support structure. Dystrophin is coded by a gene containing 79 protein-coding regions, called exons. If any one exon gets a debilitating mutation, the chain does not get built. Without dystrophin providing support, muscle tends to shred and slowly deteriorate. Duchenne affects one in 5,000 newborn males. Most patients are wheelchair-bound by age 10 and do not live beyond their 20s or early 30s, the researchers said. The mutation is on the X chromosome so female children with two X chromosomes should have at least one functioning copy of the gene. \\","size":1}]},{"name":91,"children":[{"name":" A neutral treatment of all content on the internet is an essential pre-requisite for fostering permission-less innovation which is one of the guiding principles of the internet, an IT expert said on Friday.

While China's services sector ended 2015 on a strong note, the economy still looked set to grow at its slowest pace in a quarter of a century, suggesting the government will have to step up support in 2016 to revive activity. The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)stood at 49.7 in December, in line with expectations of economists polled by Reuters and up only fractionally from November. A reading below 50 points suggests a contraction in activity, while a reading above indicates an expansion on a monthly basis. Persistently soft demand from at home and abroad has weighed on China's factories, leaving many with idle capacity and forcing them to slash selling prices, eating into their profits and adding to deflationary pressures in the broader economy. Total new orders - a proxy for both domestic and foreign demand - rose to 50.2 in December from November's 49.8, the PMI survey showed. But export orders shrank for the 15th straight month, albeit at a less severe pace. The sub-index inched up to 47.5 from November's 46.4.

We will know soon enough whether this delivers path-breaking thoughts, but don't bet on it. Bureaucrats are trained to follow rules and precedents; most of them are administrators, not problem-solving managers. That is why new ideas usually come from politicians, technocrats and civil society activists - like Annadurai's subsidised rice scheme, MGR's mid-day meals, Rajiv Gandhi's technology missions, Nandan Nilekani's 'Aadhaar' programme, and Aruna Roy's right to information campaign. Also, senior bureaucrats are usually very overworked people, and therefore unable to sit back and think of new ideas. But eight groups have been constituted, and they have been tasked with suggesting new ideas. So, for all one knows, the government's departmental secretaries might surprise the sceptics.Nevertheless, Mr Modi might find it fruitful to spare some time to look for ideas in the world of books. A well-wisher could therefore do worse than to send the prime minister a New Year gift of half a dozen books that he could read, and even re-read. By far the most important book to include in such a gift parcel would be Why Nations Fail by Daron Acemoglu and James A Robinson. This well-known work underlines the fundamental point that the difference between successful and not-so-successful countries is the quality of their institutions. Traditionally, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has tended to focus on selecting its favourite sons (and to some extent daughters) for key posts, giving less, if any, attention to the business of strengthening institutions. The Modi government has followed this pattern. All the more reason why it is important for the prime minister to internalise the fundamental importance of well-functioning institutions for shaping our future.The next most important book that Mr Modi could be offered is Poor Economics by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo. India's primary failings have been in its inability to deliver health and education for all; quite a few poorer countries have done better. It is important for the prime minister (and others) to understand why, and the easily digestible work by Banerjee-Duflo provides many answers. A third book which should be easily available to Mr Modi, because one of its authors is the vice-chairman of NITI Aayog, is Why Growth Matters - authored by Jagdish Bhagwati and Arvind Panagariya. Far too many Indian politicians underestimate the fundamental truth of that book's title - more of them are in the Congress, Socialist and Communist parties than in the BJP, but even the BJP is not sufficiently seized with the centrality of the idea (backed by multi-country experience) that the most important way to erase poverty is to ensure rapid economic growth. To be sure, there is the issue of growing inequality, and very real concerns regarding those at the bottom of the pyramid. A companion volume therefore should be An Uncertain Glory by Jean Dreze and Amartya Sen. But I would venture to suggest that the Bhagwati-Panagariya volume would be more useful just now, especially since it debunks quite a few myths that have struck root in mainstream Indian thinking.No one would be surprised by these mainstream book choices. A newly-published book that should be to Mr Modi's taste is Rebooting India: Realising a Billion Aspirations. The authors, Nandan Nilekani and Viral Shah, look at how best to tackle a dozen specific issues, covering a broad range, by using technology and organisational initiatives. Finally, since Mr Modi is about to launch his government's start-up initiative in a couple of weeks, he might do well to read a freshly minted, clear-eyed book on the subject: The Golden Tap: The Inside Story of Hyper-Funded Indian Start-Ups by Kashyap Deorah. Even for a hyper-busy prime minister who does not take any time off, these half-dozen books should not take more than a couple of weeks to absorb. It may be time better spent than waiting for new ideas from civil servants.
